Inspiration and Comparisons \u00b6 Warning The current page still doesn't have a translation for this language. But you can help translating it: Contributing . What inspired FastAPI , how it compares to other alternatives and what it learned from them. Intro \u00b6 FastAPI wouldn't exist if not for the previous work of others. There have been many tools created before that have helped inspire its creation. I have been avoiding the creation of a new framework for several years. First I tried to solve all the features covered by FastAPI using many different frameworks, plug-ins, and tools. But at some point, there was no other option than creating something that provided all these features, taking the best ideas from previous tools, and combining them in the best way possible, using language features that weren't even available before (Python 3.6+ type hints). Previous tools \u00b6 Django \u00b6 It's the most popular Python framework and is widely trusted. It is used to build systems like Instagram. It's relatively tightly coupled with relational databases (like MySQL or PostgreSQL), so, having a NoSQL database (like Couchbase, MongoDB, Cassandra, etc) as the main store engine is not very easy. It was created to generate the HTML in the backend, not to create APIs used by a modern frontend (like React, Vue.js and Angular) or by other systems (like IoT devices) communicating with it. Django REST Framework \u00b6 Django REST framework was created to be a flexible toolkit for building Web APIs using Django underneath, to improve its API capabilities. It is used by many companies including Mozilla, Red Hat and Eventbrite. It was one of the first examples of automatic API documentation , and this was specifically one of the first ideas that inspired \"the search for\" FastAPI . Note Django REST Framework was created by Tom Christie. The same creator of Starlette and Uvicorn, on which FastAPI is based. Inspired FastAPI to Have an automatic API documentation web user interface. Flask \u00b6 Flask is a \"microframework\", it doesn't include database integrations nor many of the things that come by default in Django. This simplicity and flexibility allow doing things like using NoSQL databases as the main data storage system. As it is very simple, it's relatively intuitive to learn, although the documentation gets somewhat technical at some points. It is also commonly used for other applications that don't necessarily need a database, user management, or any of the many features that come pre-built in Django. Although many of these features can be added with plug-ins. This decoupling of parts, and being a \"microframework\" that could be extended to cover exactly what is needed was a key feature that I wanted to keep. Given the simplicity of Flask, it seemed like a good match for building APIs. The next thing to find was a \"Django REST Framework\" for Flask. Inspired FastAPI to Be a micro-framework. Making it easy to mix and match the tools and parts needed. Have a simple and easy to use routing system. Requests \u00b6 FastAPI is not actually an alternative to Requests . Their scope is very different. It would actually be common to use Requests inside of a FastAPI application. But still, FastAPI got quite some inspiration from Requests. Requests is a library to interact with APIs (as a client), while FastAPI is a library to build APIs (as a server). They are, more or less, at opposite ends, complementing each other. Requests has a very simple and intuitive design, it's very easy to use, with sensible defaults. But at the same time, it's very powerful and customizable. That's why, as said in the official website: Requests is one of the most downloaded Python packages of all time The way you use it is very simple. For example, to do a GET request, you would write: response = requests . get ( \"http://example.com/some/url\" ) The FastAPI counterpart API path operation could look like: @app . get ( \"/some/url\" ) def read_url (): return { \"message\" : \"Hello World\" } See the similarities in requests.get(...) and @app.get(...) . Inspired FastAPI to Have a simple and intuitive API. Use HTTP method names (operations) directly, in a straightforward and intuitive way. Have sensible defaults, but powerful customizations. Swagger / OpenAPI \u00b6 The main feature I wanted from Django REST Framework was the automatic API documentation. Then I found that there was a standard to document APIs, using JSON (or YAML, an extension of JSON) called Swagger. And there was a web user interface for Swagger APIs already created. So, being able to generate Swagger documentation for an API would allow using this web user interface automatically. At some point, Swagger was given to the Linux Foundation, to be renamed OpenAPI. That's why when talking about version 2.0 it's common to say \"Swagger\", and for version 3+ \"OpenAPI\". Inspired FastAPI to Adopt and use an open standard for API specifications, instead of a custom schema. And integrate standards-based user interface tools: Swagger UI ReDoc These two were chosen for being fairly popular and stable, but doing a quick search, you could find dozens of additional alternative user interfaces for OpenAPI (that you can use with FastAPI ). Flask REST frameworks \u00b6 There are several Flask REST frameworks, but after investing the time and work into investigating them, I found that many are discontinued or abandoned, with several standing issues that made them unfit. Marshmallow \u00b6 One of the main features needed by API systems is data \" serialization \" which is taking data from the code (Python) and converting it into something that can be sent through the network. For example, converting an object containing data from a database into a JSON object. Converting datetime objects into strings, etc. Another big feature needed by APIs is data validation, making sure that the data is valid, given certain parameters. For example, that some field is an int , and not some random string. This is especially useful for incoming data. Without a data validation system, you would have to do all the checks by hand, in code. These features are what Marshmallow was built to provide. It is a great library, and I have used it a lot before. But it was created before there existed Python type hints. So, to define every schema you need to use specific utils and classes provided by Marshmallow. Inspired FastAPI to Use code to define \"schemas\" that provide data types and validation, automatically. Webargs \u00b6 Another big feature required by APIs is parsing data from incoming requests. Webargs is a tool that was made to provide that on top of several frameworks, including Flask. It uses Marshmallow underneath to do the data validation. And it was created by the same developers. It's a great tool and I have used it a lot too, before having FastAPI . Info Webargs was created by the same Marshmallow developers. Inspired FastAPI to Have automatic validation of incoming request data. APISpec \u00b6 Marshmallow and Webargs provide validation, parsing and serialization as plug-ins. But documentation is still missing. Then APISpec was created. It is a plug-in for many frameworks (and there's a plug-in for Starlette too). The way it works is that you write the definition of the schema using YAML format inside the docstring of each function handling a route. And it generates OpenAPI schemas. That's how it works in Flask, Starlette, Responder, etc. But then, we have again the problem of having a micro-syntax, inside of a Python string (a big YAML). The editor can't help much with that. And if we modify parameters or Marshmallow schemas and forget to also modify that YAML docstring, the generated schema would be obsolete. Info APISpec was created by the same Marshmallow developers. Inspired FastAPI to Support the open standard for APIs, OpenAPI. Flask-apispec \u00b6 It's a Flask plug-in, that ties together Webargs, Marshmallow and APISpec. It uses the information from Webargs and Marshmallow to automatically generate OpenAPI schemas, using APISpec. It's a great tool, very under-rated. It should be way more popular than many Flask plug-ins out there. It might be due to its documentation being too concise and abstract. This solved having to write YAML (another syntax) inside of Python docstrings. This combination of Flask, Flask-apispec with Marshmallow and Webargs was my favorite backend stack until building FastAPI . Using it led to the creation of several Flask full-stack generators. These are the main stack I (and several external teams) have been using up to now: https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack-flask-couchbase https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack-flask-couchdb And these same full-stack generators were the base of the FastAPI Project Generators . Info Flask-apispec was created by the same Marshmallow developers. Inspired FastAPI to Generate the OpenAPI schema automatically, from the same code that defines serialization and validation. NestJS (and Angular ) \u00b6 This isn't even Python, NestJS is a JavaScript (TypeScript) NodeJS framework inspired by Angular. It achieves something somewhat similar to what can be done with Flask-apispec. It has an integrated dependency injection system, inspired by Angular two. It requires pre-registering the \"injectables\" (like all the other dependency injection systems I know), so, it adds to the verbosity and code repetition. As the parameters are described with TypeScript types (similar to Python type hints), editor support is quite good. But as TypeScript data is not preserved after compilation to JavaScript, it cannot rely on the types to define validation, serialization and documentation at the same time. Due to this and some design decisions, to get validation, serialization and automatic schema generation, it's needed to add decorators in many places. So, it becomes quite verbose. It can't handle nested models very well. So, if the JSON body in the request is a JSON object that has inner fields that in turn are nested JSON objects, it cannot be properly documented and validated. Inspired FastAPI to Use Python types to have great editor support. Have a powerful dependency injection system. Find a way to minimize code repetition. Sanic \u00b6 It was one of the first extremely fast Python frameworks based on asyncio . It was made to be very similar to Flask. Technical Details It used uvloop instead of the default Python asyncio loop. That's what made it so fast. It clearly inspired Uvicorn and Starlette, that are currently faster than Sanic in open benchmarks. Inspired FastAPI to Find a way to have a crazy performance. That's why FastAPI is based on Starlette, as it is the fastest framework available (tested by third-party benchmarks). Falcon \u00b6 Falcon is another high performance Python framework, it is designed to be minimal, and work as the foundation of other frameworks like Hug. It is designed to have functions that receive two parameters, one \"request\" and one \"response\". Then you \"read\" parts from the request, and \"write\" parts to the response. Because of this design, it is not possible to declare request parameters and bodies with standard Python type hints as function parameters. So, data validation, serialization, and documentation, have to be done in code, not automatically. Or they have to be implemented as a framework on top of Falcon, like Hug. This same distinction happens in other frameworks that are inspired by Falcon's design, of having one request object and one response object as parameters. Inspired FastAPI to Find ways to get great performance. Along with Hug (as Hug is based on Falcon) inspired FastAPI to declare a response parameter in functions. Although in FastAPI it's optional, and is used mainly to set headers, cookies, and alternative status codes. Molten \u00b6 I discovered Molten in the first stages of building FastAPI . And it has quite similar ideas: Based on Python type hints. Validation and documentation from these types. Dependency Injection system. It doesn't use a data validation, serialization and documentation third-party library like Pydantic, it has its own. So, these data type definitions would not be reusable as easily. It requires a little bit more verbose configurations. And as it is based on WSGI (instead of ASGI), it is not designed to take advantage of the high-performance provided by tools like Uvicorn, Starlette and Sanic. The dependency injection system requires pre-registration of the dependencies and the dependencies are solved based on the declared types. So, it's not possible to declare more than one \"component\" that provides a certain type. Routes are declared in a single place, using functions declared in other places (instead of using decorators that can be placed right on top of the function that handles the endpoint). This is closer to how Django does it than to how Flask (and Starlette) does it. It separates in the code things that are relatively tightly coupled. Inspired FastAPI to Define extra validations for data types using the \"default\" value of model attributes. This improves editor support, and it was not available in Pydantic before. This actually inspired updating parts of Pydantic, to support the same validation declaration style (all this functionality is now already available in Pydantic). Hug \u00b6 Hug was one of the first frameworks to implement the declaration of API parameter types using Python type hints. This was a great idea that inspired other tools to do the same. It used custom types in its declarations instead of standard Python types, but it was still a huge step forward. It also was one of the first frameworks to generate a custom schema declaring the whole API in JSON. It was not based on a standard like OpenAPI and JSON Schema. So it wouldn't be straightforward to integrate it with other tools, like Swagger UI. But again, it was a very innovative idea. It has an interesting, uncommon feature: using the same framework, it's possible to create APIs and also CLIs. As it is based on the previous standard for synchronous Python web frameworks (WSGI), it can't handle Websockets and other things, although it still has high performance too. Info Hug was created by Timothy Crosley, the same creator of isort , a great tool to automatically sort imports in Python files. Ideas inspired in FastAPI Hug inspired parts of APIStar, and was one of the tools I found most promising, alongside APIStar. Hug helped inspiring FastAPI to use Python type hints to declare parameters, and to generate a schema defining the API automatically. Hug inspired FastAPI to declare a response parameter in functions to set headers and cookies. APIStar (<= 0.5) \u00b6 Right before deciding to build FastAPI I found APIStar server. It had almost everything I was looking for and had a great design. It was one of the first implementations of a framework using Python type hints to declare parameters and requests that I ever saw (before NestJS and Molten). I found it more or less at the same time as Hug. But APIStar used the OpenAPI standard. It had automatic data validation, data serialization and OpenAPI schema generation based on the same type hints in several places. Body schema definitions didn't use the same Python type hints like Pydantic, it was a bit more similar to Marshmallow, so, editor support wouldn't be as good, but still, APIStar was the best available option. It had the best performance benchmarks at the time (only surpassed by Starlette). At first, it didn't have an automatic API documentation web UI, but I knew I could add Swagger UI to it. It had a dependency injection system. It required pre-registration of components, as other tools discussed above. But still, it was a great feature. I was never able to use it in a full project, as it didn't have security integration, so, I couldn't replace all the features I was having with the full-stack generators based on Flask-apispec. I had in my backlog of projects to create a pull request adding that functionality. But then, the project's focus shifted. It was no longer an API web framework, as the creator needed to focus on Starlette. Now APIStar is a set of tools to validate OpenAPI specifications, not a web framework. Info APIStar was created by Tom Christie. The same guy that created: Django REST Framework Starlette (in which FastAPI is based) Uvicorn (used by Starlette and FastAPI ) Inspired FastAPI to Exist. The idea of declaring multiple things (data validation, serialization and documentation) with the same Python types, that at the same time provided great editor support, was something I considered a brilliant idea. And after searching for a long time for a similar framework and testing many different alternatives, APIStar was the best option available. Then APIStar stopped to exist as a server and Starlette was created, and was a new better foundation for such a system. That was the final inspiration to build FastAPI . I consider FastAPI a \"spiritual successor\" to APIStar, while improving and increasing the features, typing system, and other parts, based on the learnings from all these previous tools. Used by FastAPI \u00b6 Pydantic \u00b6 Pydantic is a library to define data validation, serialization and documentation (using JSON Schema) based on Python type hints. That makes it extremely intuitive. It is comparable to Marshmallow. Although it's faster than Marshmallow in benchmarks. And as it is based on the same Python type hints, the editor support is great. FastAPI uses it to Handle all the data validation, data serialization and automatic model documentation (based on JSON Schema). FastAPI then takes that JSON Schema data and puts it in OpenAPI, apart from all the other things it does. Starlette \u00b6 Starlette is a lightweight ASGI framework/toolkit, which is ideal for building high-performance asyncio services. It is very simple and intuitive. It's designed to be easily extensible, and have modular components. It has: Seriously impressive performance. WebSocket support. In-process background tasks. Startup and shutdown events. Test client built on requests. CORS, GZip, Static Files, Streaming responses. Session and Cookie support. 100% test coverage. 100% type annotated codebase. Few hard dependencies. Starlette is currently the fastest Python framework tested. Only surpassed by Uvicorn, which is not a framework, but a server. Starlette provides all the basic web microframework functionality. But it doesn't provide automatic data validation, serialization or documentation. That's one of the main things that FastAPI adds on top, all based on Python type hints (using Pydantic). That, plus the dependency injection system, security utilities, OpenAPI schema generation, etc. Technical Details ASGI is a new \"standard\" being developed by Django core team members. It is still not a \"Python standard\" (a PEP), although they are in the process of doing that. Nevertheless, it is already being used as a \"standard\" by several tools. This greatly improves interoperability, as you could switch Uvicorn for any other ASGI server (like Daphne or Hypercorn), or you could add ASGI compatible tools, like python-socketio . FastAPI uses it to Handle all the core web parts. Adding features on top. The class FastAPI itself inherits directly from the class Starlette . So, anything that you can do with Starlette, you can do it directly with FastAPI , as it is basically Starlette on steroids. Uvicorn \u00b6 Uvicorn is a lightning-fast ASGI server, built on uvloop and httptools. It is not a web framework, but a server. For example, it doesn't provide tools for routing by paths. That's something that a framework like Starlette (or FastAPI ) would provide on top. It is the recommended server for Starlette and FastAPI . FastAPI recommends it as The main web server to run FastAPI applications. You can combine it with Gunicorn, to have an asynchronous multi-process server. Check more details in the Deployment section.

Requests has a very simple and intuitive design, it's very easy to use, with sensible defaults. But at the same time, it's very powerful and customizable. That's why, as said in the official website: Requests is one of the most downloaded Python packages of all time The way you use it is very simple. For example, to do a GET request, you would write: response = requests . get ( \"http://example.com/some/url\" ) The FastAPI counterpart API path operation could look like: @app . get ( \"/some/url\" ) def read_url (): return { \"message\" : \"Hello World\" } See the similarities in requests.get(...) and @app.get(...) .

For example, that some field is an int , and not some random string. This is especially useful for incoming data. Without a data validation system, you would have to do all the checks by hand, in code. These features are what Marshmallow was built to provide. It is a great library, and I have used it a lot before. But it was created before there existed Python type hints.

That's how it works in Flask, Starlette, Responder, etc. But then, we have again the problem of having a micro-syntax, inside of a Python string (a big YAML). The editor can't help much with that.

This solved having to write YAML (another syntax) inside of Python docstrings.

But as TypeScript data is not preserved after compilation to JavaScript, it cannot rely on the types to define validation, serialization and documentation at the same time. Due to this and some design decisions, to get validation, serialization and automatic schema generation, it's needed to add decorators in many places. So, it becomes quite verbose. It can't handle nested models very well.

In a hurry? \u00b6 TL;DR: If you are using third party libraries that tell you to call them with await , like: results = await some_library () Then, declare your path operation functions with async def like: @app . get ( '/' ) async def read_results (): results = await some_library () return results Note You can only use await inside of functions created with async def .

If you just don't know, use normal def . Note : you can mix def and async def in your path operation functions as much as you need and define each one using the best option for you. FastAPI will do the right thing with them. Anyway, in any of the cases above, FastAPI will still work asynchronously and be extremely fast. But by following the steps above, it will be able to do some performance optimizations. Technical Details \u00b6 Modern versions of Python have support for \"asynchronous code\" using something called \"coroutines\" , with async and await syntax. Let's see that phrase by parts in the sections below: Asynchronous Code async and await Coroutines Asynchronous Code \u00b6 Asynchronous code just means that the language \ud83d\udcac has a way to tell the computer / program \ud83e\udd16 that at some point in the code, it \ud83e\udd16 will have to wait for something else to finish somewhere else. Let's say that something else is called \"slow-file\" \ud83d\udcdd. So, during that time, the computer can go and do some other work, while \"slow-file\" \ud83d\udcdd finishes. Then the computer / program \ud83e\udd16 will come back every time it has a chance because it's waiting again, or whenever it \ud83e\udd16 finished all the work it had at that point. And it \ud83e\udd16 will see if any of the tasks it was waiting for have already finished, doing whatever it had to do. Next, it \ud83e\udd16 takes the first task to finish (let's say, our \"slow-file\" \ud83d\udcdd) and continues whatever it had to do with it. That \"wait for something else\" normally refers to I/O operations that are relatively \"slow\" (compared to the speed of the processor and the RAM memory), like waiting for: the data from the client to be sent through the network the data sent by your program to be received by the client through the network the contents of a file in the disk to be read by the system and given to your program the contents your program gave to the system to be written to disk a remote API operation a database operation to finish a database query to return the results etc. As the execution time is consumed mostly by waiting for I/O operations, they call them \"I/O bound\" operations. It's called \"asynchronous\" because the computer / program doesn't have to be \"synchronized\" with the slow task, waiting for the exact moment that the task finishes, while doing nothing, to be able to take the task result and continue the work. Instead of that, by being an \"asynchronous\" system, once finished, the task can wait in line a little bit (some microseconds) for the computer / program to finish whatever it went to do, and then come back to take the results and continue working with them. For \"synchronous\" (contrary to \"asynchronous\") they commonly also use the term \"sequential\", because the computer / program follows all the steps in sequence before switching to a different task, even if those steps involve waiting. Concurrency and Burgers \u00b6 This idea of asynchronous code described above is also sometimes called \"concurrency\" . It is different from \"parallelism\" . Concurrency and parallelism both relate to \"different things happening more or less at the same time\". But the details between concurrency and parallelism are quite different. To see the difference, imagine the following story about burgers: Concurrent Burgers \u00b6 You go with your crush \ud83d\ude0d to get fast food \ud83c\udf54, you stand in line while the cashier \ud83d\udc81 takes the orders from the people in front of you. Then it's your turn, you place your order of 2 very fancy burgers \ud83c\udf54 for your crush \ud83d\ude0d and you. You pay \ud83d\udcb8. The cashier \ud83d\udc81 says something to the cook in the kitchen \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73 so they know they have to prepare your burgers \ud83c\udf54 (even though they are currently preparing the ones for the previous clients). The cashier \ud83d\udc81 gives you the number of your turn. While you are waiting, you go with your crush \ud83d\ude0d and pick a table, you sit and talk with your crush \ud83d\ude0d for a long time (as your burgers are very fancy and take some time to prepare \u2728\ud83c\udf54\u2728). As you are sitting at the table with your crush \ud83d\ude0d, while you wait for the burgers \ud83c\udf54, you can spend that time admiring how awesome, cute and smart your crush is \u2728\ud83d\ude0d\u2728. While waiting and talking to your crush \ud83d\ude0d, from time to time, you check the number displayed on the counter to see if it's your turn already. Then at some point, it finally is your turn. You go to the counter, get your burgers \ud83c\udf54 and come back to the table. You and your crush \ud83d\ude0d eat the burgers \ud83c\udf54 and have a nice time \u2728. Imagine you are the computer / program \ud83e\udd16 in that story. While you are at the line, you are just idle \ud83d\ude34, waiting for your turn, not doing anything very \"productive\". But the line is fast because the cashier \ud83d\udc81 is only taking the orders (not preparing them), so that's fine. Then, when it's your turn, you do actual \"productive\" work \ud83e\udd13, you process the menu, decide what you want, get your crush's \ud83d\ude0d choice, pay \ud83d\udcb8, check that you give the correct bill or card, check that you are charged correctly, check that the order has the correct items, etc. But then, even though you still don't have your burgers \ud83c\udf54, your work with the cashier \ud83d\udc81 is \"on pause\" \u23f8, because you have to wait \ud83d\udd59 for your burgers to be ready. But as you go away from the counter and sit at the table with a number for your turn, you can switch \ud83d\udd00 your attention to your crush \ud83d\ude0d, and \"work\" \u23ef \ud83e\udd13 on that. Then you are again doing something very \"productive\" \ud83e\udd13, as is flirting with your crush \ud83d\ude0d. Then the cashier \ud83d\udc81 says \"I'm finished with doing the burgers\" \ud83c\udf54 by putting your number on the counter's display, but you don't jump like crazy immediately when the displayed number changes to your turn number. You know no one will steal your burgers \ud83c\udf54 because you have the number of your turn, and they have theirs. So you wait for your crush \ud83d\ude0d to finish the story (finish the current work \u23ef / task being processed \ud83e\udd13), smile gently and say that you are going for the burgers \u23f8. Then you go to the counter \ud83d\udd00, to the initial task that is now finished \u23ef, pick the burgers \ud83c\udf54, say thanks and take them to the table. That finishes that step / task of interaction with the counter \u23f9. That in turn, creates a new task, of \"eating burgers\" \ud83d\udd00 \u23ef, but the previous one of \"getting burgers\" is finished \u23f9. Parallel Burgers \u00b6 Now let's imagine these aren't \"Concurrent Burgers\", but \"Parallel Burgers\". You go with your crush \ud83d\ude0d to get parallel fast food \ud83c\udf54. You stand in line while several (let's say 8) cashiers that at the same time are cooks \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73 take the orders from the people in front of you. Everyone before you is waiting \ud83d\udd59 for their burgers \ud83c\udf54 to be ready before leaving the counter because each of the 8 cashiers goes and prepares the burger right away before getting the next order. Then it's finally your turn, you place your order of 2 very fancy burgers \ud83c\udf54 for your crush \ud83d\ude0d and you. You pay \ud83d\udcb8. The cashier goes to the kitchen \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73. You wait, standing in front of the counter \ud83d\udd59, so that no one else takes your burgers \ud83c\udf54 before you do, as there are no numbers for turns. As you and your crush \ud83d\ude0d are busy not letting anyone get in front of you and take your burgers whenever they arrive \ud83d\udd59, you cannot pay attention to your crush \ud83d\ude1e. This is \"synchronous\" work, you are \"synchronized\" with the cashier/cook \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73. You have to wait \ud83d\udd59 and be there at the exact moment that the cashier/cook \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73 finishes the burgers \ud83c\udf54 and gives them to you, or otherwise, someone else might take them. Then your cashier/cook \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73 finally comes back with your burgers \ud83c\udf54, after a long time waiting \ud83d\udd59 there in front of the counter. You take your burgers \ud83c\udf54 and go to the table with your crush \ud83d\ude0d. You just eat them, and you are done \ud83c\udf54 \u23f9. There was not much talk or flirting as most of the time was spent waiting \ud83d\udd59 in front of the counter \ud83d\ude1e. In this scenario of the parallel burgers, you are a computer / program \ud83e\udd16 with two processors (you and your crush \ud83d\ude0d), both waiting \ud83d\udd59 and dedicating their attention \u23ef to be \"waiting on the counter\" \ud83d\udd59 for a long time. The fast food store has 8 processors (cashiers/cooks) \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73. While the concurrent burgers store might have had only 2 (one cashier and one cook) \ud83d\udc81 \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73. But still, the final experience is not the best \ud83d\ude1e. This would be the parallel equivalent story for burgers \ud83c\udf54. For a more \"real life\" example of this, imagine a bank. Up to recently, most of the banks had multiple cashiers \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbc\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbc\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbc\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbc and a big line \ud83d\udd59\ud83d\udd59\ud83d\udd59\ud83d\udd59\ud83d\udd59\ud83d\udd59\ud83d\udd59\ud83d\udd59. All of the cashiers doing all the work with one client after the other \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbc\u23ef. And you have to wait \ud83d\udd59 in the line for a long time or you lose your turn. You probably wouldn't want to take your crush \ud83d\ude0d with you to do errands at the bank \ud83c\udfe6. Burger Conclusion \u00b6 In this scenario of \"fast food burgers with your crush\", as there is a lot of waiting \ud83d\udd59, it makes a lot more sense to have a concurrent system \u23f8\ud83d\udd00\u23ef. This is the case for most of the web applications. Many, many users, but your server is waiting \ud83d\udd59 for their not-so-good connection to send their requests. And then waiting \ud83d\udd59 again for the responses to come back. This \"waiting\" \ud83d\udd59 is measured in microseconds, but still, summing it all, it's a lot of waiting in the end. That's why it makes a lot of sense to use asynchronous \u23f8\ud83d\udd00\u23ef code for web APIs. Most of the existing popular Python frameworks (including Flask and Django) were created before the new asynchronous features in Python existed. So, the ways they can be deployed support parallel execution and an older form of asynchronous execution that is not as powerful as the new capabilities. Even though the main specification for asynchronous web Python (ASGI) was developed at Django, to add support for WebSockets. That kind of asynchronicity is what made NodeJS popular (even though NodeJS is not parallel) and that's the strength of Go as a programming language. And that's the same level of performance you get with FastAPI . And as you can have parallelism and asynchronicity at the same time, you get higher performance than most of the tested NodeJS frameworks and on par with Go, which is a compiled language closer to C (all thanks to Starlette) . Is concurrency better than parallelism? \u00b6 Nope! That's not the moral of the story. Concurrency is different than parallelism. And it is better on specific scenarios that involve a lot of waiting. Because of that, it generally is a lot better than parallelism for web application development. But not for everything. So, to balance that out, imagine the following short story: You have to clean a big, dirty house. Yep, that's the whole story . There's no waiting \ud83d\udd59 anywhere, just a lot of work to be done, on multiple places of the house. You could have turns as in the burgers example, first the living room, then the kitchen, but as you are not waiting \ud83d\udd59 for anything, just cleaning and cleaning, the turns wouldn't affect anything. It would take the same amount of time to finish with or without turns (concurrency) and you would have done the same amount of work. But in this case, if you could bring the 8 ex-cashier/cooks/now-cleaners \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73, and each one of them (plus you) could take a zone of the house to clean it, you could do all the work in parallel , with the extra help, and finish much sooner. In this scenario, each one of the cleaners (including you) would be a processor, doing their part of the job. And as most of the execution time is taken by actual work (instead of waiting), and the work in a computer is done by a CPU , they call these problems \"CPU bound\". Common examples of CPU bound operations are things that require complex math processing. For example: Audio or image processing . Computer vision : an image is composed of millions of pixels, each pixel has 3 values / colors, processing that normally requires computing something on those pixels, all at the same time. Machine Learning : it normally requires lots of \"matrix\" and \"vector\" multiplications. Think of a huge spreadsheet with numbers and multiplying all of them together at the same time. Deep Learning : this is a sub-field of Machine Learning, so, the same applies. It's just that there is not a single spreadsheet of numbers to multiply, but a huge set of them, and in many cases, you use a special processor to build and / or use those models. Concurrency + Parallelism: Web + Machine Learning \u00b6 With FastAPI you can take the advantage of concurrency that is very common for web development (the same main attractive of NodeJS). But you can also exploit the benefits of parallelism and multiprocessing (having multiple processes running in parallel) for CPU bound workloads like those in Machine Learning systems. That, plus the simple fact that Python is the main language for Data Science , Machine Learning and especially Deep Learning, make FastAPI a very good match for Data Science / Machine Learning web APIs and applications (among many others). To see how to achieve this parallelism in production see the section about Deployment . async and await \u00b6 Modern versions of Python have a very intuitive way to define asynchronous code. This makes it look just like normal \"sequential\" code and do the \"awaiting\" for you at the right moments. When there is an operation that will require waiting before giving the results and has support for these new Python features, you can code it like: burgers = await get_burgers ( 2 ) The key here is the await . It tells Python that it has to wait \u23f8 for get_burgers(2) to finish doing its thing \ud83d\udd59 before storing the results in burgers . With that, Python will know that it can go and do something else \ud83d\udd00 \u23ef in the meanwhile (like receiving another request). For await to work, it has to be inside a function that supports this asynchronicity. To do that, you just declare it with async def : async def get_burgers ( number : int ): # Do some asynchronous stuff to create the burgers return burgers ...instead of def : # This is not asynchronous def get_sequential_burgers ( number : int ): # Do some sequential stuff to create the burgers return burgers With async def , Python knows that, inside that function, it has to be aware of await expressions, and that it can \"pause\" \u23f8 the execution of that function and go do something else \ud83d\udd00 before coming back. When you want to call an async def function, you have to \"await\" it. So, this won't work: # This won't work, because get_burgers was defined with: async def burgers = get_burgers ( 2 ) So, if you are using a library that tells you that you can call it with await , you need to create the path operation functions that uses it with async def , like in: @app . get ( '/burgers' ) async def read_burgers (): burgers = await get_burgers ( 2 ) return burgers More technical details \u00b6 You might have noticed that await can only be used inside of functions defined with async def . But at the same time, functions defined with async def have to be \"awaited\". So, functions with async def can only be called inside of functions defined with async def too. So, about the egg and the chicken, how do you call the first async function? If you are working with FastAPI you don't have to worry about that, because that \"first\" function will be your path operation function , and FastAPI will know how to do the right thing. But if you want to use async / await without FastAPI, you can do it as well. Write your own async code \u00b6 Starlette (and FastAPI ) are based on AnyIO , which makes it compatible with both Python's standard library asyncio and Trio . In particular, you can directly use AnyIO for your advanced concurrency use cases that require more advanced patterns in your own code. And even if you were not using FastAPI, you could also write your own async applications with AnyIO to be highly compatible and get its benefits (e.g. structured concurrency ). Other forms of asynchronous code \u00b6 This style of using async and await is relatively new in the language. But it makes working with asynchronous code a lot easier. This same syntax (or almost identical) was also included recently in modern versions of JavaScript (in Browser and NodeJS). But before that, handling asynchronous code was quite more complex and difficult. In previous versions of Python, you could have used threads or Gevent . But the code is way more complex to understand, debug, and think about. In previous versions of NodeJS / Browser JavaScript, you would have used \"callbacks\". Which leads to callback hell . Coroutines \u00b6 Coroutine is just the very fancy term for the thing returned by an async def function. Python knows that it is something like a function that it can start and that it will end at some point, but that it might be paused \u23f8 internally too, whenever there is an await inside of it. But all this functionality of using asynchronous code with async and await is many times summarized as using \"coroutines\". It is comparable to the main key feature of Go, the \"Goroutines\". Conclusion \u00b6 Let's see the same phrase from above: Modern versions of Python have support for \"asynchronous code\" using something called \"coroutines\" , with async and await syntax. That should make more sense now. \u2728 All that is what powers FastAPI (through Starlette) and what makes it have such an impressive performance. Very Technical Details \u00b6 Warning You can probably skip this. These are very technical details of how FastAPI works underneath. If you have quite some technical knowledge (co-routines, threads, blocking, etc) and are curious about how FastAPI handles async def vs normal def , go ahead. Path operation functions \u00b6 When you declare a path operation function with normal def instead of async def , it is run in an external threadpool that is then awaited, instead of being called directly (as it would block the server). If you are coming from another async framework that does not work in the way described above and you are used to define trivial compute-only path operation functions with plain def for a tiny performance gain (about 100 nanoseconds), please note that in FastAPI the effect would be quite opposite. In these cases, it's better to use async def unless your path operation functions use code that performs blocking I/O . Still, in both situations, chances are that FastAPI will still be faster than (or at least comparable to) your previous framework. Dependencies \u00b6 The same applies for dependencies. If a dependency is a standard def function instead of async def , it is run in the external threadpool. Sub-dependencies \u00b6 You can have multiple dependencies and sub-dependencies requiring each other (as parameters of the function definitions), some of them might be created with async def and some with normal def . It would still work, and the ones created with normal def would be called on an external thread (from the threadpool) instead of being \"awaited\". Other utility functions \u00b6 Any other utility function that you call directly can be created with normal def or async def and FastAPI won't affect the way you call it. This is in contrast to the functions that FastAPI calls for you: path operation functions and dependencies. If your utility function is a normal function with def , it will be called directly (as you write it in your code), not in a threadpool, if the function is created with async def then you should await for that function when you call it in your code. Again, these are very technical details that would probably be useful if you came searching for them. Otherwise, you should be good with the guidelines from the section above: In a hurry? .","title":"Concurrency and async / await"},{"location":"async/#concurrency-and-async-await","text":"Warning The current page still doesn't have a translation for this language.

If you are using a third party library that communicates with something (a database, an API, the file system, etc) and doesn't have support for using await , (this is currently the case for most database libraries), then declare your path operation functions as normally, with just def , like: @app . get ( '/' ) def results (): results = some_library () return results If your application (somehow) doesn't have to communicate with anything else and wait for it to respond, use async def . If you just don't know, use normal def . Note : you can mix def and async def in your path operation functions as much as you need and define each one using the best option for you. FastAPI will do the right thing with them. Anyway, in any of the cases above, FastAPI will still work asynchronously and be extremely fast.

Let's say that something else is called \"slow-file\" \ud83d\udcdd. So, during that time, the computer can go and do some other work, while \"slow-file\" \ud83d\udcdd finishes. Then the computer / program \ud83e\udd16 will come back every time it has a chance because it's waiting again, or whenever it \ud83e\udd16 finished all the work it had at that point. And it \ud83e\udd16 will see if any of the tasks it was waiting for have already finished, doing whatever it had to do. Next, it \ud83e\udd16 takes the first task to finish (let's say, our \"slow-file\" \ud83d\udcdd) and continues whatever it had to do with it. That \"wait for something else\" normally refers to I/O operations that are relatively \"slow\" (compared to the speed of the processor and the RAM memory), like waiting for: the data from the client to be sent through the network the data sent by your program to be received by the client through the network the contents of a file in the disk to be read by the system and given to your program the contents your program gave to the system to be written to disk a remote API operation a database operation to finish a database query to return the results etc. As the execution time is consumed mostly by waiting for I/O operations, they call them \"I/O bound\" operations. It's called \"asynchronous\" because the computer / program doesn't have to be \"synchronized\" with the slow task, waiting for the exact moment that the task finishes, while doing nothing, to be able to take the task result and continue the work. Instead of that, by being an \"asynchronous\" system, once finished, the task can wait in line a little bit (some microseconds) for the computer / program to finish whatever it went to do, and then come back to take the results and continue working with them. For \"synchronous\" (contrary to \"asynchronous\") they commonly also use the term \"sequential\", because the computer / program follows all the steps in sequence before switching to a different task, even if those steps involve waiting.","title":"Asynchronous Code"},{"location":"async/#concurrency-and-burgers","text":"This idea of asynchronous code described above is also sometimes called \"concurrency\" .

Then it's finally your turn, you place your order of 2 very fancy burgers \ud83c\udf54 for your crush \ud83d\ude0d and you. You pay \ud83d\udcb8. The cashier goes to the kitchen \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73. You wait, standing in front of the counter \ud83d\udd59, so that no one else takes your burgers \ud83c\udf54 before you do, as there are no numbers for turns. As you and your crush \ud83d\ude0d are busy not letting anyone get in front of you and take your burgers whenever they arrive \ud83d\udd59, you cannot pay attention to your crush \ud83d\ude1e. This is \"synchronous\" work, you are \"synchronized\" with the cashier/cook \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73. You have to wait \ud83d\udd59 and be there at the exact moment that the cashier/cook \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73 finishes the burgers \ud83c\udf54 and gives them to you, or otherwise, someone else might take them. Then your cashier/cook \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73 finally comes back with your burgers \ud83c\udf54, after a long time waiting \ud83d\udd59 there in front of the counter. You take your burgers \ud83c\udf54 and go to the table with your crush \ud83d\ude0d. You just eat them, and you are done \ud83c\udf54 \u23f9. There was not much talk or flirting as most of the time was spent waiting \ud83d\udd59 in front of the counter \ud83d\ude1e. In this scenario of the parallel burgers, you are a computer / program \ud83e\udd16 with two processors (you and your crush \ud83d\ude0d), both waiting \ud83d\udd59 and dedicating their attention \u23ef to be \"waiting on the counter\" \ud83d\udd59 for a long time. The fast food store has 8 processors (cashiers/cooks) \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73. While the concurrent burgers store might have had only 2 (one cashier and one cook) \ud83d\udc81 \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73. But still, the final experience is not the best \ud83d\ude1e. This would be the parallel equivalent story for burgers \ud83c\udf54. For a more \"real life\" example of this, imagine a bank. Up to recently, most of the banks had multiple cashiers \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbc\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbc\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbc\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbc and a big line \ud83d\udd59\ud83d\udd59\ud83d\udd59\ud83d\udd59\ud83d\udd59\ud83d\udd59\ud83d\udd59\ud83d\udd59. All of the cashiers doing all the work with one client after the other \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbc\u23ef. And you have to wait \ud83d\udd59 in the line for a long time or you lose your turn. You probably wouldn't want to take your crush \ud83d\ude0d with you to do errands at the bank \ud83c\udfe6.","title":"Parallel Burgers"},{"location":"async/#burger-conclusion","text":"In this scenario of \"fast food burgers with your crush\", as there is a lot of waiting \ud83d\udd59, it makes a lot more sense to have a concurrent system \u23f8\ud83d\udd00\u23ef. This is the case for most of the web applications. Many, many users, but your server is waiting \ud83d\udd59 for their not-so-good connection to send their requests. And then waiting \ud83d\udd59 again for the responses to come back. This \"waiting\" \ud83d\udd59 is measured in microseconds, but still, summing it all, it's a lot of waiting in the end. That's why it makes a lot of sense to use asynchronous \u23f8\ud83d\udd00\u23ef code for web APIs. Most of the existing popular Python frameworks (including Flask and Django) were created before the new asynchronous features in Python existed. So, the ways they can be deployed support parallel execution and an older form of asynchronous execution that is not as powerful as the new capabilities. Even though the main specification for asynchronous web Python (ASGI) was developed at Django, to add support for WebSockets. That kind of asynchronicity is what made NodeJS popular (even though NodeJS is not parallel) and that's the strength of Go as a programming language. And that's the same level of performance you get with FastAPI . And as you can have parallelism and asynchronicity at the same time, you get higher performance than most of the tested NodeJS frameworks and on par with Go, which is a compiled language closer to C (all thanks to Starlette) .","title":"Burger Conclusion"},{"location":"async/#is-concurrency-better-than-parallelism","text":"Nope! That's not the moral of the story. Concurrency is different than parallelism. And it is better on specific scenarios that involve a lot of waiting. Because of that, it generally is a lot better than parallelism for web application development. But not for everything. So, to balance that out, imagine the following short story: You have to clean a big, dirty house. Yep, that's the whole story . There's no waiting \ud83d\udd59 anywhere, just a lot of work to be done, on multiple places of the house. You could have turns as in the burgers example, first the living room, then the kitchen, but as you are not waiting \ud83d\udd59 for anything, just cleaning and cleaning, the turns wouldn't affect anything. It would take the same amount of time to finish with or without turns (concurrency) and you would have done the same amount of work. But in this case, if you could bring the 8 ex-cashier/cooks/now-cleaners \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73, and each one of them (plus you) could take a zone of the house to clean it, you could do all the work in parallel , with the extra help, and finish much sooner. In this scenario, each one of the cleaners (including you) would be a processor, doing their part of the job. And as most of the execution time is taken by actual work (instead of waiting), and the work in a computer is done by a CPU , they call these problems \"CPU bound\". Common examples of CPU bound operations are things that require complex math processing. For example: Audio or image processing . Computer vision : an image is composed of millions of pixels, each pixel has 3 values / colors, processing that normally requires computing something on those pixels, all at the same time. Machine Learning : it normally requires lots of \"matrix\" and \"vector\" multiplications. Think of a huge spreadsheet with numbers and multiplying all of them together at the same time. Deep Learning : this is a sub-field of Machine Learning, so, the same applies. It's just that there is not a single spreadsheet of numbers to multiply, but a huge set of them, and in many cases, you use a special processor to build and / or use those models.","title":"Is concurrency better than parallelism?"},{"location":"async/#concurrency-parallelism-web-machine-learning","text":"With FastAPI you can take the advantage of concurrency that is very common for web development (the same main attractive of NodeJS).

When there is an operation that will require waiting before giving the results and has support for these new Python features, you can code it like: burgers = await get_burgers ( 2 ) The key here is the await . It tells Python that it has to wait \u23f8 for get_burgers(2) to finish doing its thing \ud83d\udd59 before storing the results in burgers . With that, Python will know that it can go and do something else \ud83d\udd00 \u23ef in the meanwhile (like receiving another request). For await to work, it has to be inside a function that supports this asynchronicity. To do that, you just declare it with async def : async def get_burgers ( number : int ): # Do some asynchronous stuff to create the burgers return burgers ...instead of def : # This is not asynchronous def get_sequential_burgers ( number : int ): # Do some sequential stuff to create the burgers return burgers With async def , Python knows that, inside that function, it has to be aware of await expressions, and that it can \"pause\" \u23f8 the execution of that function and go do something else \ud83d\udd00 before coming back. When you want to call an async def function, you have to \"await\" it. So, this won't work: # This won't work, because get_burgers was defined with: async def burgers = get_burgers ( 2 ) So, if you are using a library that tells you that you can call it with await , you need to create the path operation functions that uses it with async def , like in: @app . get ( '/burgers' ) async def read_burgers (): burgers = await get_burgers ( 2 ) return burgers","title":"async and await"},{"location":"async/#more-technical-details","text":"You might have noticed that await can only be used inside of functions defined with async def .

But you can help translating it: Contributing . First, you might want to see the basic ways to help FastAPI and get help . Developing \u00b6 If you already cloned the repository and you know that you need to deep dive in the code, here are some guidelines to set up your environment. Virtual environment with venv \u00b6 You can create a virtual environment in a directory using Python's venv module: $ python -m venv env That will create a directory ./env/ with the Python binaries and then you will be able to install packages for that isolated environment. Activate the environment \u00b6 Activate the new environment with: Linux, macOS Windows PowerShell Windows Bash $ source ./env/bin/activate $ . \\e nv \\S cripts \\A ctivate.ps1 Or if you use Bash for Windows (e.g. Git Bash ): $ source ./env/Scripts/activate To check it worked, use: Linux, macOS, Windows Bash Windows PowerShell $ which pip some/directory/fastapi/env/bin/pip $ Get-Command pip some/directory/fastapi/env/bin/pip If it shows the pip binary at env/bin/pip then it worked. \ud83c\udf89 Tip Every time you install a new package with pip under that environment, activate the environment again. This makes sure that if you use a terminal program installed by that package (like flit ), you use the one from your local environment and not any other that could be installed globally. Flit \u00b6 FastAPI uses Flit to build, package and publish the project. After activating the environment as described above, install flit : $ pip install flit ---> 100% Now re-activate the environment to make sure you are using the flit you just installed (and not a global one). And now use flit to install the development dependencies: Linux, macOS Windows $ flit install --deps develop --symlink ---> 100% If you are on Windows, use --pth-file instead of --symlink : $ flit install --deps develop --pth-file ---> 100% It will install all the dependencies and your local FastAPI in your local environment. Using your local FastAPI \u00b6 If you create a Python file that imports and uses FastAPI, and run it with the Python from your local environment, it will use your local FastAPI source code. And if you update that local FastAPI source code, as it is installed with --symlink (or --pth-file on Windows), when you run that Python file again, it will use the fresh version of FastAPI you just edited. That way, you don't have to \"install\" your local version to be able to test every change. Format \u00b6 There is a script that you can run that will format and clean all your code: $ bash scripts/format.sh It will also auto-sort all your imports. For it to sort them correctly, you need to have FastAPI installed locally in your environment, with the command in the section above using --symlink (or --pth-file on Windows). Docs \u00b6 First, make sure you set up your environment as described above, that will install all the requirements. The documentation uses MkDocs . And there are extra tools/scripts in place to handle translations in ./scripts/docs.py . Tip You don't need to see the code in ./scripts/docs.py , you just use it in the command line. All the documentation is in Markdown format in the directory ./docs/en/ . Many of the tutorials have blocks of code. In most of the cases, these blocks of code are actual complete applications that can be run as is. In fact, those blocks of code are not written inside the Markdown, they are Python files in the ./docs_src/ directory. And those Python files are included/injected in the documentation when generating the site. Docs for tests \u00b6 Most of the tests actually run against the example source files in the documentation. This helps making sure that: The documentation is up to date. The documentation examples can be run as is. Most of the features are covered by the documentation, ensured by test coverage. During local development, there is a script that builds the site and checks for any changes, live-reloading: $ python ./scripts/docs.py live <span style=\"color: green;\">[INFO]</span> Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8008 <span style=\"color: green;\">[INFO]</span> Start watching changes <span style=\"color: green;\">[INFO]</span> Start detecting changes It will serve the documentation on http://127.0.0.1:8008 . That way, you can edit the documentation/source files and see the changes live. Typer CLI (optional) \u00b6 The instructions here show you how to use the script at ./scripts/docs.py with the python program directly. But you can also use Typer CLI , and you will get autocompletion in your terminal for the commands after installing completion. If you install Typer CLI, you can install completion with: $ typer --install-completion zsh completion installed in /home/user/.bashrc. Completion will take effect once you restart the terminal. Apps and docs at the same time \u00b6 If you run the examples with, e.g.: $ uvicorn tutorial001:app --reload <span style=\"color: green;\">INFO</span>: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit) as Uvicorn by default will use the port 8000 , the documentation on port 8008 won't clash. Translations \u00b6 Help with translations is VERY MUCH appreciated! And it can't be done without the help from the community. \ud83c\udf0e \ud83d\ude80 Here are the steps to help with translations. Tips and guidelines \u00b6 Check the currently existing pull requests for your language and add reviews requesting changes or approving them. Tip You can add comments with change suggestions to existing pull requests. Check the docs about adding a pull request review to approve it or request changes. Check in the issues to see if there's one coordinating translations for your language. Add a single pull request per page translated. That will make it much easier for others to review it. For the languages I don't speak, I'll wait for several others to review the translation before merging. You can also check if there are translations for your language and add a review to them, that will help me know that the translation is correct and I can merge it. Use the same Python examples and only translate the text in the docs. You don't have to change anything for this to work. Use the same images, file names, and links. You don't have to change anything for it to work. To check the 2-letter code for the language you want to translate you can use the table List of ISO 639-1 codes . Existing language \u00b6 Let's say you want to translate a page for a language that already has translations for some pages, like Spanish. In the case of Spanish, the 2-letter code is es . So, the directory for Spanish translations is located at docs/es/ . Tip The main (\"official\") language is English, located at docs/en/ . Now run the live server for the docs in Spanish: // Use the command \"live\" and pass the language code as a CLI argument $ python ./scripts/docs.py live es <span style=\"color: green;\">[INFO]</span> Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8008 <span style=\"color: green;\">[INFO]</span> Start watching changes <span style=\"color: green;\">[INFO]</span> Start detecting changes Now you can go to http://127.0.0.1:8008 and see your changes live. If you look at the FastAPI docs website, you will see that every language has all the pages. But some pages are not translated and have a notification about the missing translation. But when you run it locally like this, you will only see the pages that are already translated. Now let's say that you want to add a translation for the section Features . Copy the file at: docs/en/docs/features.md Paste it in exactly the same location but for the language you want to translate, e.g.: docs/es/docs/features.md Tip Notice that the only change in the path and file name is the language code, from en to es . Now open the MkDocs config file for English at: docs/en/mkdocs.yml Find the place where that docs/features.md is located in the config file. Somewhere like: site_name : FastAPI # More stuff nav : - FastAPI : index.md - Languages : - en : / - es : /es/ - features.md Open the MkDocs config file for the language you are editing, e.g.: docs/es/mkdocs.yml Add it there at the exact same location it was for English, e.g.: site_name : FastAPI # More stuff nav : - FastAPI : index.md - Languages : - en : / - es : /es/ - features.md Make sure that if there are other entries, the new entry with your translation is exactly in the same order as in the English version. If you go to your browser you will see that now the docs show your new section. \ud83c\udf89 Now you can translate it all and see how it looks as you save the file. New Language \u00b6 Let's say that you want to add translations for a language that is not yet translated, not even some pages. Let's say you want to add translations for Creole, and it's not yet there in the docs. Checking the link from above, the code for \"Creole\" is ht . The next step is to run the script to generate a new translation directory: // Use the command new-lang, pass the language code as a CLI argument $ python ./scripts/docs.py new-lang ht Successfully initialized: docs/ht Updating ht Updating en Now you can check in your code editor the newly created directory docs/ht/ . Tip Create a first pull request with just this, to set up the configuration for the new language, before adding translations. That way others can help with other pages while you work on the first one. \ud83d\ude80 Start by translating the main page, docs/ht/index.md . Then you can continue with the previous instructions, for an \"Existing Language\". New Language not supported \u00b6 If when running the live server script you get an error about the language not being supported, something like: raise TemplateNotFound(template) jinja2.exceptions.TemplateNotFound: partials/language/xx.html That means that the theme doesn't support that language (in this case, with a fake 2-letter code of xx ). But don't worry, you can set the theme language to English and then translate the content of the docs. If you need to do that, edit the mkdocs.yml for your new language, it will have something like: site_name : FastAPI # More stuff theme : # More stuff language : xx Change that language from xx (from your language code) to en . Then you can start the live server again. Preview the result \u00b6 When you use the script at ./scripts/docs.py with the live command it only shows the files and translations available for the current language. But once you are done, you can test it all as it would look online. To do that, first build all the docs: // Use the command \"build-all\", this will take a bit $ python ./scripts/docs.py build-all Updating es Updating en Building docs for: en Building docs for: es Successfully built docs for: es Copying en index.md to README.md That generates all the docs at ./docs_build/ for each language. This includes adding any files with missing translations, with a note saying that \"this file doesn't have a translation yet\". But you don't have to do anything with that directory. Then it builds all those independent MkDocs sites for each language, combines them, and generates the final output at ./site/ . Then you can serve that with the command serve : // Use the command \"serve\" after running \"build-all\" $ python ./scripts/docs.py serve Warning: this is a very simple server. For development, use mkdocs serve instead. This is here only to preview a site with translations already built. Make sure you run the build-all command first. Serving at: http://127.0.0.1:8008 Tests \u00b6 There is a script that you can run locally to test all the code and generate coverage reports in HTML: $ bash scripts/test-cov-html.sh This command generates a directory ./htmlcov/ , if you open the file ./htmlcov/index.html in your browser, you can explore interactively the regions of code that are covered by the tests, and notice if there is any region missing.","title":"Development - Contributing"},{"location":"contributing/#development-contributing","text":"Warning The current page still doesn't have a translation for this language.

Tip You can add comments with change suggestions to existing pull requests. Check the docs about adding a pull request review to approve it or request changes. Check in the issues to see if there's one coordinating translations for your language. Add a single pull request per page translated. That will make it much easier for others to review it. For the languages I don't speak, I'll wait for several others to review the translation before merging. You can also check if there are translations for your language and add a review to them, that will help me know that the translation is correct and I can merge it. Use the same Python examples and only translate the text in the docs. You don't have to change anything for this to work. Use the same images, file names, and links. You don't have to change anything for it to work.

But you can help translating it: Contributing . FastAPI features \u00b6 FastAPI gives you the following: Based on open standards \u00b6 OpenAPI for API creation, including declarations of path operations , parameters, body requests, security, etc. Automatic data model documentation with JSON Schema (as OpenAPI itself is based on JSON Schema). Designed around these standards, after a meticulous study. Instead of an afterthought layer on top. This also allows using automatic client code generation in many languages. Automatic docs \u00b6 Interactive API documentation and exploration web user interfaces. As the framework is based on OpenAPI, there are multiple options, 2 included by default. Swagger UI , with interactive exploration, call and test your API directly from the browser. Alternative API documentation with ReDoc . Just Modern Python \u00b6 It's all based on standard Python 3.6 type declarations (thanks to Pydantic). No new syntax to learn. Just standard modern Python. If you need a 2 minute refresher of how to use Python types (even if you don't use FastAPI), check the short tutorial: Python Types . You write standard Python with types: from datetime import date from pydantic import BaseModel # Declare a variable as a str # and get editor support inside the function def main ( user_id : str ): return user_id # A Pydantic model class User ( BaseModel ): id : int name : str joined : date That can then be used like: my_user : User = User ( id = 3 , name = \"John Doe\" , joined = \"2018-07-19\" ) second_user_data = { \"id\" : 4 , \"name\" : \"Mary\" , \"joined\" : \"2018-11-30\" , } my_second_user : User = User ( ** second_user_data ) Info **second_user_data means: Pass the keys and values of the second_user_data dict directly as key-value arguments, equivalent to: User(id=4, name=\"Mary\", joined=\"2018-11-30\") Editor support \u00b6 All the framework was designed to be easy and intuitive to use, all the decisions were tested on multiple editors even before starting development, to ensure the best development experience. In the last Python developer survey it was clear that the most used feature is \"autocompletion\" . The whole FastAPI framework is based to satisfy that. Autocompletion works everywhere. You will rarely need to come back to the docs. Here's how your editor might help you: in Visual Studio Code : in PyCharm : You will get completion in code you might even consider impossible before. As for example, the price key inside a JSON body (that could have been nested) that comes from a request. No more typing the wrong key names, coming back and forth between docs, or scrolling up and down to find if you finally used username or user_name . Short \u00b6 It has sensible defaults for everything, with optional configurations everywhere. All the parameters can be fine-tuned to do what you need and to define the API you need. But by default, it all \"just works\" . Validation \u00b6 Validation for most (or all?) Python data types , including: JSON objects ( dict ). JSON array ( list ) defining item types. String ( str ) fields, defining min and max lengths. Numbers ( int , float ) with min and max values, etc. Validation for more exotic types, like: URL. Email. UUID. ...and others. All the validation is handled by the well-established and robust Pydantic . Security and authentication \u00b6 Security and authentication integrated. Without any compromise with databases or data models. All the security schemes defined in OpenAPI, including: HTTP Basic. OAuth2 (also with JWT tokens ). Check the tutorial on OAuth2 with JWT . API keys in: Headers. Query parameters. Cookies, etc. Plus all the security features from Starlette (including session cookies ). All built as reusable tools and components that are easy to integrate with your systems, data stores, relational and NoSQL databases, etc. Dependency Injection \u00b6 FastAPI includes an extremely easy to use, but extremely powerful Dependency Injection system. Even dependencies can have dependencies, creating a hierarchy or \"graph\" of dependencies . All automatically handled by the framework. All the dependencies can require data from requests and augment the path operation constraints and automatic documentation. Automatic validation even for path operation parameters defined in dependencies. Support for complex user authentication systems, database connections , etc. No compromise with databases, frontends, etc. But easy integration with all of them. Unlimited \"plug-ins\" \u00b6 Or in other way, no need for them, import and use the code you need. Any integration is designed to be so simple to use (with dependencies) that you can create a \"plug-in\" for your application in 2 lines of code using the same structure and syntax used for your path operations . Tested \u00b6 100% test coverage . 100% type annotated code base. Used in production applications. Starlette features \u00b6 FastAPI is fully compatible with (and based on) Starlette . So, any additional Starlette code you have, will also work. FastAPI is actually a sub-class of Starlette . So, if you already know or use Starlette, most of the functionality will work the same way. With FastAPI you get all of Starlette 's features (as FastAPI is just Starlette on steroids): Seriously impressive performance. It is one of the fastest Python frameworks available, on par with NodeJS and Go . WebSocket support. In-process background tasks. Startup and shutdown events. Test client built on requests . CORS , GZip, Static Files, Streaming responses. Session and Cookie support. 100% test coverage. 100% type annotated codebase. Pydantic features \u00b6 FastAPI is fully compatible with (and based on) Pydantic . So, any additional Pydantic code you have, will also work. Including external libraries also based on Pydantic, as ORM s, ODM s for databases. This also means that in many cases you can pass the same object you get from a request directly to the database , as everything is validated automatically. The same applies the other way around, in many cases you can just pass the object you get from the database directly to the client . With FastAPI you get all of Pydantic 's features (as FastAPI is based on Pydantic for all the data handling): No brainfuck : No new schema definition micro-language to learn. If you know Python types you know how to use Pydantic. Plays nicely with your IDE / linter /brain : Because pydantic data structures are just instances of classes you define; auto-completion, linting, mypy and your intuition should all work properly with your validated data. Fast : in benchmarks Pydantic is faster than all other tested libraries. Validate complex structures : Use of hierarchical Pydantic models, Python typing \u2019s List and Dict , etc. And validators allow complex data schemas to be clearly and easily defined, checked and documented as JSON Schema. You can have deeply nested JSON objects and have them all validated and annotated. Extendible : Pydantic allows custom data types to be defined or you can extend validation with methods on a model decorated with the validator decorator. 100% test coverage.","title":"Features"},{"location":"features/#features","text":"Warning The current page still doesn't have a translation for this language.

By doing it, you will receive notifications (in your email) whenever there's a new release (a new version) of FastAPI with bug fixes and new features. Connect with the author \u00b6 You can connect with me (Sebasti\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez / tiangolo ) , the author. You can: Follow me on GitHub . See other Open Source projects I have created that could help you. Follow me to see when I create a new Open Source project. Follow me on Twitter . Tell me how you use FastAPI (I love to hear that). Hear when I make announcements or release new tools. You can also follow @fastapi on Twitter (a separate account). Connect with me on Linkedin . Hear when I make announcements or release new tools (although I use Twitter more often \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642). Read what I write (or follow me) on Dev.to or Medium .

Vote for FastAPI in AlternativeTo . Help others with issues in GitHub \u00b6 You can see existing issues and try and help others, most of the times they are questions that you might already know the answer for. \ud83e\udd13 If you are helping a lot of people with issues, you might become an official FastAPI Expert . \ud83c\udf89 Watch the GitHub repository \u00b6 You can \"watch\" FastAPI in GitHub (clicking the \"watch\" button at the top right): https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi . \ud83d\udc40 If you select \"Watching\" instead of \"Releases only\" you will receive notifications when someone creates a new issue. Then you can try and help them solve those issues. Create issues \u00b6 You can create a new issue in the GitHub repository, for example to: Ask a question or ask about a problem . Suggest a new feature . Note : if you create an issue, then I'm going to ask you to also help others. \ud83d\ude09 Create a Pull Request \u00b6 You can contribute to the source code with Pull Requests, for example: To fix a typo you found on the documentation. To share an article, video, or podcast you created or found about FastAPI by editing this file . Make sure you add your link to the start of the corresponding section. To help translate the documentation to your language. You can also help to review the translations created by others. To propose new documentation sections. To fix an existing issue/bug. To add a new feature. Join the chat \u00b6 Join the \ud83d\udc65 Discord chat server \ud83d\udc65 and hang out with others in the FastAPI community. Tip For questions, ask them in GitHub issues , there's a much better chance you will receive help by the FastAPI Experts . Use the chat only for other general conversations. There is also the previous Gitter chat , but as it doesn't have channels and advanced features, conversations are more difficult, so Discord is now the recommended system. Don't use the chat for questions \u00b6 Have in mind that as chats allow more \"free conversation\", it's easy to ask questions that are too general and more difficult to answer, so, you might not receive answers. In GitHub issues the template will guide you to write the right question so that you can more easily get a good answer, or even solve the problem yourself even before asking. And in GitHub I can make sure I always answer everything, even if it takes some time. I can't personally do that with the chat systems. \ud83d\ude05 Conversations in the chat systems are also not as easily searchable as in GitHub, so questions and answers might get lost in the conversation. And only the ones in GitHub issues count to become a FastAPI Expert , so you will most probably receive more attention in GitHub issues. On the other side, there are thousands of users in the chat systems, so there's a high chance you'll find someone to talk to there, almost all the time. \ud83d\ude04 Sponsor the author \u00b6 You can also financially support the author (me) through GitHub sponsors . There you could buy me a coffee \u2615\ufe0f to say thanks. \ud83d\ude04 And you can also become a Silver or Gold sponsor for FastAPI. \ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udf89 Sponsor the tools that power FastAPI \u00b6 As you have seen in the documentation, FastAPI stands on the shoulders of giants, Starlette and Pydantic.

Alternatives \u00b6 I have been creating APIs with complex requirements for several years (Machine Learning, distributed systems, asynchronous jobs, NoSQL databases, etc), leading several teams of developers.

I have been avoiding the creation of a new framework for several years. First I tried to solve all the features covered by FastAPI using many different frameworks, plug-ins, and tools. But at some point, there was no other option than creating something that provided all these features, taking the best ideas from previous tools, and combining them in the best way possible, using language features that weren't even available before (Python 3.6+ type hints). Investigation \u00b6 By using all the previous alternatives I had the chance to learn from all of them, take ideas, and combine them in the best way I could find for myself and the teams of developers I have worked with. For example, it was clear that ideally it should be based on standard Python type hints. Also, the best approach was to use already existing standards.

But you can help translating it: Contributing . Python has support for optional \"type hints\". These \"type hints\" are a special syntax that allow declaring the type of a variable. By declaring types for your variables, editors and tools can give you better support. This is just a quick tutorial / refresher about Python type hints. It covers only the minimum necessary to use them with FastAPI ... which is actually very little. FastAPI is all based on these type hints, they give it many advantages and benefits. But even if you never use FastAPI , you would benefit from learning a bit about them. Note If you are a Python expert, and you already know everything about type hints, skip to the next chapter. Motivation \u00b6 Let's start with a simple example: def get_full_name ( first_name , last_name ): full_name = first_name . title () + \" \" + last_name . title () return full_name print ( get_full_name ( \"john\" , \"doe\" )) Calling this program outputs: John Doe The function does the following: Takes a first_name and last_name . Converts the first letter of each one to upper case with title() . Concatenates them with a space in the middle. def get_full_name ( first_name , last_name ): full_name = first_name . title () + \" \" + last_name . title () return full_name print ( get_full_name ( \"john\" , \"doe\" )) Edit it \u00b6 It's a very simple program. But now imagine that you were writing it from scratch. At some point you would have started the definition of the function, you had the parameters ready... But then you have to call \"that method that converts the first letter to upper case\". Was it upper ? Was it uppercase ? first_uppercase ? capitalize ? Then, you try with the old programmer's friend, editor autocompletion. You type the first parameter of the function, first_name , then a dot ( . ) and then hit Ctrl+Space to trigger the completion. But, sadly, you get nothing useful: Add types \u00b6 Let's modify a single line from the previous version. We will change exactly this fragment, the parameters of the function, from: first_name , last_name to: first_name : str , last_name : str That's it. Those are the \"type hints\": def get_full_name ( first_name : str , last_name : str ): full_name = first_name . title () + \" \" + last_name . title () return full_name print ( get_full_name ( \"john\" , \"doe\" )) That is not the same as declaring default values like would be with: first_name = \"john\" , last_name = \"doe\" It's a different thing. We are using colons ( : ), not equals ( = ). And adding type hints normally doesn't change what happens from what would happen without them. But now, imagine you are again in the middle of creating that function, but with type hints. At the same point, you try to trigger the autocomplete with Ctrl+Space and you see: With that, you can scroll, seeing the options, until you find the one that \"rings a bell\": More motivation \u00b6 Check this function, it already has type hints: def get_name_with_age ( name : str , age : int ): name_with_age = name + \" is this old: \" + age return name_with_age Because the editor knows the types of the variables, you don't only get completion, you also get error checks: Now you know that you have to fix it, convert age to a string with str(age) : def get_name_with_age ( name : str , age : int ): name_with_age = name + \" is this old: \" + str ( age ) return name_with_age Declaring types \u00b6 You just saw the main place to declare type hints. As function parameters. This is also the main place you would use them with FastAPI . Simple types \u00b6 You can declare all the standard Python types, not only str . You can use, for example: int float bool bytes def get_items ( item_a : str , item_b : int , item_c : float , item_d : bool , item_e : bytes ): return item_a , item_b , item_c , item_d , item_d , item_e Generic types with type parameters \u00b6 There are some data structures that can contain other values, like dict , list , set and tuple . And the internal values can have their own type too. These types that have internal types are called \" generic \" types. And it's possible to declare them, even with their internal types. To declare those types and the internal types, you can use the standard Python module typing . It exists specifically to support these type hints. Newer versions of Python \u00b6 The syntax using typing is compatible with all versions, from Python 3.6 to the latest ones, including Python 3.9, Python 3.10, etc. As Python advances, newer versions come with improved support for these type annotations and in many cases you won't even need to import and use the typing module to declare the type annotations. If you can chose a more recent version of Python for your project, you will be able to take advantage of that extra simplicity. See some examples below. List \u00b6 For example, let's define a variable to be a list of str . Python 3.6 and above Python 3.9 and above From typing , import List (with a capital L ): from typing import List def process_items ( items : List [ str ]): for item in items : print ( item ) Declare the variable, with the same colon ( : ) syntax. As the type, put the List that you imported from typing . As the list is a type that contains some internal types, you put them in square brackets: from typing import List def process_items ( items : List [ str ]): for item in items : print ( item ) Declare the variable, with the same colon ( : ) syntax. As the type, put list . As the list is a type that contains some internal types, you put them in square brackets: def process_items ( items : list [ str ]): for item in items : print ( item ) Info Those internal types in the square brackets are called \"type parameters\". In this case, str is the type parameter passed to List (or list in Python 3.9 and above). That means: \"the variable items is a list , and each of the items in this list is a str \". Tip If you use Python 3.9 or above, you don't have to import List from typing , you can use the same regular list type instead. By doing that, your editor can provide support even while processing items from the list: Without types, that's almost impossible to achieve. Notice that the variable item is one of the elements in the list items . And still, the editor knows it is a str , and provides support for that. Tuple and Set \u00b6 You would do the same to declare tuple s and set s: Python 3.6 and above Python 3.9 and above from typing import Set , Tuple def process_items ( items_t : Tuple [ int , int , str ], items_s : Set [ bytes ]): return items_t , items_s def process_items ( items_t : tuple [ int , int , str ], items_s : set [ bytes ]): return items_t , items_s This means: The variable items_t is a tuple with 3 items, an int , another int , and a str . The variable items_s is a set , and each of its items is of type bytes . Dict \u00b6 To define a dict , you pass 2 type parameters, separated by commas. The first type parameter is for the keys of the dict . The second type parameter is for the values of the dict : Python 3.6 and above Python 3.9 and above from typing import Dict def process_items ( prices : Dict [ str , float ]): for item_name , item_price in prices . items (): print ( item_name ) print ( item_price ) def process_items ( prices : dict [ str , float ]): for item_name , item_price in prices . items (): print ( item_name ) print ( item_price ) This means: The variable prices is a dict : The keys of this dict are of type str (let's say, the name of each item). The values of this dict are of type float (let's say, the price of each item). Union \u00b6 You can declare that a variable can be any of several types , for example, an int or a str . In Python 3.6 and above (including Python 3.10) you can use the Union type from typing and put inside the square brackets the possible types to accept. In Python 3.10 there's also an alternative syntax were you can put the possible types separated by a vertical bar ( | ) . Python 3.6 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Union def process_item ( item : Union [ int , str ]): print ( item ) def process_item ( item : int | str ): print ( item ) In both cases this means that item could be an int or a str . Possibly None \u00b6 You can declare that a value could have a type, like str , but that it could also be None . In Python 3.6 and above (including Python 3.10) you can declare it by importing and using Optional from the typing module. from typing import Optional def say_hi ( name : Optional [ str ] = None ): if name is not None : print ( f \"Hey { name } !\" ) else : print ( \"Hello World\" ) Using Optional[str] instead of just str will let the editor help you detecting errors where you could be assuming that a value is always a str , when it could actually be None too. Optional[Something] is actually a shortcut for Union[Something, None] , they are equivalent. This also means that in Python 3.10, you can use Something | None : Python 3.6 and above Python 3.6 and above - alternative Python 3.10 and above from typing import Optional def say_hi ( name : Optional [ str ] = None ): if name is not None : print ( f \"Hey { name } !\" ) else : print ( \"Hello World\" ) from typing import Union def say_hi ( name : Union [ str , None ] = None ): if name is not None : print ( f \"Hey { name } !\" ) else : print ( \"Hello World\" ) def say_hi ( name : str | None = None ): if name is not None : print ( f \"Hey { name } !\" ) else : print ( \"Hello World\" ) Using Union or Optional \u00b6 If you are using a Python version below 3.10, here's a tip from my very subjective point of view: \ud83d\udea8 Avoid using Optional[SomeType] Instead \u2728 use Union[SomeType, None] \u2728. Both are equivalent and underneath they are the same, but I would recommend Union instead of Optional because the word \" optional \" would seem to imply that the value is optional, and it actually means \"it can be None \", even if it's not optional and is still required. I think Union[str, SomeType] is more explicit about what it means. It's just about the words and names. But those words can affect how you and your teammates think about the code. As an example, let's take this function: from typing import Optional def say_hi ( name : Optional [ str ]): print ( f \"Hey { name } !\" ) The parameter name is defined as Optional[str] , but it is not optional , you cannot call the function without the parameter: say_hi () # Oh, no, this throws an error! \ud83d\ude31 The name parameter is still required (not optional ) because it doesn't have a default value. Still, name accepts None as the value: say_hi ( name = None ) # This works, None is valid \ud83c\udf89 The good news is, once you are on Python 3.10 you won't have to worry about that, as you will be able to simply use | to define unions of types: def say_hi ( name : str | None ): print ( f \"Hey { name } !\" ) And then you won't have to worry about names like Optional and Union . \ud83d\ude0e Generic types \u00b6 These types that take type parameters in square brackets are called Generic types or Generics , for example: Python 3.6 and above Python 3.9 and above Python 3.10 and above List Tuple Set Dict Union Optional ...and others. You can use the same builtin types as generics (with square brakets and types inside): list tuple set dict And the same as with Python 3.6, from the typing module: Union Optional ...and others. You can use the same builtin types as generics (with square brakets and types inside): list tuple set dict And the same as with Python 3.6, from the typing module: Union Optional (the same as with Python 3.6) ...and others. In Python 3.10, as an alternative to using the generics Union and Optional , you can use the vertical bar ( | ) to declare unions of types. Classes as types \u00b6 You can also declare a class as the type of a variable. Let's say you have a class Person , with a name: class Person : def __init__ ( self , name : str ): self . name = name def get_person_name ( one_person : Person ): return one_person . name Then you can declare a variable to be of type Person : class Person : def __init__ ( self , name : str ): self . name = name def get_person_name ( one_person : Person ): return one_person . name And then, again, you get all the editor support: Pydantic models \u00b6 Pydantic is a Python library to perform data validation. You declare the \"shape\" of the data as classes with attributes. And each attribute has a type. Then you create an instance of that class with some values and it will validate the values, convert them to the appropriate type (if that's the case) and give you an object with all the data. And you get all the editor support with that resulting object. An example from the official Pydantic docs: Python 3.6 and above Python 3.9 and above Python 3.10 and above from datetime import datetime from typing import List , Union from pydantic import BaseModel class User ( BaseModel ): id : int name = \"John Doe\" signup_ts : Union [ datetime , None ] = None friends : List [ int ] = [] external_data = { \"id\" : \"123\" , \"signup_ts\" : \"2017-06-01 12:22\" , \"friends\" : [ 1 , \"2\" , b \"3\" ], } user = User ( ** external_data ) print ( user ) # > User id=123 name='John Doe' signup_ts=datetime.datetime(2017, 6, 1, 12, 22) friends=[1, 2, 3] print ( user . id ) # > 123 from datetime import datetime from typing import Union from pydantic import BaseModel class User ( BaseModel ): id : int name = \"John Doe\" signup_ts : Union [ datetime , None ] = None friends : list [ int ] = [] external_data = { \"id\" : \"123\" , \"signup_ts\" : \"2017-06-01 12:22\" , \"friends\" : [ 1 , \"2\" , b \"3\" ], } user = User ( ** external_data ) print ( user ) # > User id=123 name='John Doe' signup_ts=datetime.datetime(2017, 6, 1, 12, 22) friends=[1, 2, 3] print ( user . id ) # > 123 from datetime import datetime from pydantic import BaseModel class User ( BaseModel ): id : int name = \"John Doe\" signup_ts : datetime | None = None friends : list [ int ] = [] external_data = { \"id\" : \"123\" , \"signup_ts\" : \"2017-06-01 12:22\" , \"friends\" : [ 1 , \"2\" , b \"3\" ], } user = User ( ** external_data ) print ( user ) # > User id=123 name='John Doe' signup_ts=datetime.datetime(2017, 6, 1, 12, 22) friends=[1, 2, 3] print ( user . id ) # > 123 Info To learn more about Pydantic, check its docs . FastAPI is all based on Pydantic. You will see a lot more of all this in practice in the Tutorial - User Guide . Tip Pydantic has a special behavior when you use Optional or Union[Something, None] without a default value, you can read more about it in the Pydantic docs about Required Optional fields . Type hints in FastAPI \u00b6 FastAPI takes advantage of these type hints to do several things. With FastAPI you declare parameters with type hints and you get: Editor support . Type checks . ...and FastAPI uses the same declarations to: Define requirements : from request path parameters, query parameters, headers, bodies, dependencies, etc. Convert data : from the request to the required type. Validate data : coming from each request: Generating automatic errors returned to the client when the data is invalid. Document the API using OpenAPI: which is then used by the automatic interactive documentation user interfaces. This might all sound abstract. Don't worry. You'll see all this in action in the Tutorial - User Guide . The important thing is that by using standard Python types, in a single place (instead of adding more classes, decorators, etc), FastAPI will do a lot of the work for you.

As an example, let's take this function: from typing import Optional def say_hi ( name : Optional [ str ]): print ( f \"Hey { name } !\" ) The parameter name is defined as Optional[str] , but it is not optional , you cannot call the function without the parameter: say_hi () # Oh, no, this throws an error! \ud83d\ude31 The name parameter is still required (not optional ) because it doesn't have a default value.

New docs: Advanced - Generate Clients . PR #4650 by @tiangolo . 0.74.1 \u00b6 Features \u00b6 \u2728 Include route in scope to allow middleware and other tools to extract its information. PR #4603 by @tiangolo . 0.74.0 \u00b6 Breaking Changes \u00b6 \u2728 Update internal AsyncExitStack to fix context for dependencies with yield . PR #4575 by @tiangolo . Dependencies with yield can now catch HTTPException and custom exceptions. For example: async def get_database (): with Session () as session : try : yield session except HTTPException : session . rollback () raise finally : session . close () After the dependency with yield handles the exception (or not) the exception is raised again. So that any exception handlers can catch it, or ultimately the default internal ServerErrorMiddleware . If you depended on exceptions not being received by dependencies with yield , and receiving an exception breaks the code after yield , you can use a block with try and finally : async def do_something (): try : yield something finally : some_cleanup () ...that way the finally block is run regardless of any exception that might happen. Features \u00b6 The same PR #4575 from above also fixes the contextvars context for the code before and after yield . This was the main objective of that PR. This means that now, if you set a value in a context variable before yield , the value would still be available after yield (as you would intuitively expect). And it also means that you can reset the context variable with a token afterwards. For example, this works correctly now: from contextvars import ContextVar from typing import Any , Dict , Optional legacy_request_state_context_var : ContextVar [ Optional [ Dict [ str , Any ]]] = ContextVar ( \"legacy_request_state_context_var\" , default = None ) async def set_up_request_state_dependency (): request_state = { \"user\" : \"deadpond\" } contextvar_token = legacy_request_state_context_var . set ( request_state ) yield request_state legacy_request_state_context_var . reset ( contextvar_token ) ...before this change it would raise an error when resetting the context variable, because the contextvars context was different, because of the way it was implemented. Note : You probably don't need contextvars , and you should probably avoid using them. But they are powerful and useful in some advanced scenarios, for example, migrating from code that used Flask's g semi-global variable.

PR #4274 by @github-actions[bot] . 0.70.0 \u00b6 This release just upgrades Starlette to the latest version, 0.16.0 , which includes several bug fixes and some small breaking changes. These last three consecutive releases are independent so that you can migrate gradually : First to FastAPI 0.68.2 , with no breaking changes, but upgrading all the sub-dependencies. Next to FastAPI 0.69.0 , which upgrades Starlette to 0.15.0 , with AnyIO support, and a higher chance of having breaking changes in your code. Finally to FastAPI 0.70.0 , just upgrading Starlette to the latest version 0.16.0 with additional bug fixes.

This change fixes a CSRF security vulnerability when using cookies for authentication in path operations with JSON payloads sent by browsers. In versions lower than 0.65.2 , FastAPI would try to read the request payload as JSON even if the content-type header sent was not set to application/json or a compatible JSON media type (e.g. application/geo+json ). So, a request with a content type of text/plain containing JSON data would be accepted and the JSON data would be extracted. But requests with content type text/plain are exempt from CORS preflights, for being considered Simple requests . So, the browser would execute them right away including cookies, and the text content could be a JSON string that would be parsed and accepted by the FastAPI application.

PR #2476 by @tiangolo . 0.62.0 \u00b6 Features \u00b6 \u2728 Add support for shared/top-level parameters (dependencies, tags, etc). PR #2434 by @tiangolo . Up to now, for several options, the only way to apply them to a group of path operations was in include_router . That works well, but the call to app.include_router() or router.include_router() is normally done in another file. That means that, for example, to apply authentication to all the path operations in a router it would end up being done in a different file, instead of keeping related logic together. Setting options in include_router still makes sense in some cases, for example, to override or increase configurations from a third party router included in an app. But in a router that is part of a bigger application, it would probably make more sense to add those settings when creating the APIRouter . In FastAPI This allows setting the (mostly new) parameters (additionally to the already existing parameters): default_response_class : updated to handle defaults in APIRouter and include_router . dependencies : to include \u2728 top-level dependencies \u2728 that apply to the whole application. E.g. to add global authentication. callbacks : OpenAPI callbacks that apply to all the path operations . deprecated : to mark all the path operations as deprecated. \ud83e\udd37 include_in_schema : to allow excluding all the path operations from the OpenAPI schema. responses : OpenAPI responses that apply to all the path operations . For example: from fastapi import FastAPI , Depends async def some_dependency (): return app = FastAPI ( dependencies = [ Depends ( some_dependency )]) In APIRouter This allows setting the (mostly new) parameters (additionally to the already existing parameters): default_response_class : updated to handle defaults in APIRouter and include_router . For example, it's not needed to set it explicitly when creating callbacks . dependencies : to include \u2728 router-level dependencies \u2728 that apply to all the path operations in a router. Up to now, this was only possible with include_router . callbacks : OpenAPI callbacks that apply to all the path operations in this router. deprecated : to mark all the path operations in a router as deprecated. include_in_schema : to allow excluding all the path operations in a router from the OpenAPI schema. responses : OpenAPI responses that apply to all the path operations in a router. prefix : to set the path prefix for a router. Up to now, this was only possible when calling include_router . tags : OpenAPI tags to apply to all the path operations in this router. For example: from fastapi import APIRouter , Depends async def some_dependency (): return router = APIRouter ( prefix = \"/users\" , dependencies = [ Depends ( some_dependency )]) In include_router Most of these settings are now supported in APIRouter , which normally lives closer to the related code, so it is recommended to use APIRouter when possible. But include_router is still useful to, for example, adding options (like dependencies , prefix , and tags ) when including a third party router, or a generic router that is shared between several projects. This PR allows setting the (mostly new) parameters (additionally to the already existing parameters): default_response_class : updated to handle defaults in APIRouter and FastAPI . deprecated : to mark all the path operations in a router as deprecated in OpenAPI. include_in_schema : to allow disabling all the path operations from showing in the OpenAPI schema. callbacks : OpenAPI callbacks that apply to all the path operations in this router. Note: all the previous parameters are still there, so it's still possible to declare dependencies in include_router . Breaking Changes \u00b6 PR #2434 includes several improvements that shouldn't affect normal use cases, but could affect in advanced scenarios: If you are testing the generated OpenAPI (you shouldn't, FastAPI already tests it extensively for you): the order for tags in include_router and path operations was updated for consistency, but it's a simple order change. If you have advanced custom logic to access each route's route.response_class , or the router.default_response_class , or the app.default_response_class : the default value for response_class in APIRoute and for default_response_class in APIRouter and FastAPI is now a DefaultPlaceholder used internally to handle and solve default values and overrides. The actual response class inside the DefaultPlaceholder is available at route.response_class.value .

Fix OpenAPI/JSON Schema generation for two functions with the same name (in different modules) with the same composite bodies. Composite bodies' IDs are now based on path, not only on route name, as the auto-generated name uses the function names, that can be duplicated in different modules. The same new ID generation applies to response models. This also changes the generated title for those models. Only composite bodies and response models are affected because those are generated dynamically, they don't have a module (a Python file). This also adds the possibility of using .include_router() with the same APIRouter multiple times, with different prefixes, e.g. /api/v2 and /api/latest , and it will now work correctly.

New docs: SQL (Relational) Databases . The new support for ORM mode fixes issues/adds features related to ORMs with lazy-loading, hybrid properties, dynamic/getters (using @property decorators) and several other use cases. This applies to ORMs like SQLAlchemy, Peewee, Tortoise ORM, GINO ORM and virtually any other. If your path operations return an arbitrary object with attributes (e.g. my_item.name instead of my_item[\"name\"] ) AND you use a response_model , make sure to update the Pydantic models with orm_mode = True as described in the docs (link above). New documentation about receiving plain dict s as request bodies: Bodies of arbitrary dict s . New documentation about returning arbitrary dict s in responses: Response with arbitrary dict . Technical Details : When declaring a response_model it is used directly to generate the response content, from whatever was returned from the path operation function . Before this, the return content was first passed through jsonable_encoder to ensure it was a \"jsonable\" object, like a dict , instead of an arbitrary object with attributes (like an ORM model). That's why you should make sure to update your Pydantic models for objects with attributes to use orm_mode = True . If you don't have a response_model , the return object will still be passed through jsonable_encoder first. When a response_model is declared, the same response_model type declaration won't be used as is, it will be \"cloned\" to create an new one (a cloned Pydantic Field with all the submodels cloned as well). This avoids/fixes a potential security issue: as the returned object is passed directly to Pydantic, if the returned object was a subclass of the response_model (e.g. you return a UserInDB that inherits from User but contains extra fields, like hashed_password , and User is used in the response_model ), it would still pass the validation (because UserInDB is a subclass of User ) and the object would be returned as-is, including the hashed_password . To fix this, the declared response_model is cloned, if it is a Pydantic model class (or contains Pydantic model classes in it, e.g. in a List[Item] ), the Pydantic model class(es) will be a different one (the \"cloned\" one). So, an object that is a subclass won't simply pass the validation and returned as-is, because it is no longer a sub-class of the cloned response_model . Instead, a new Pydantic model object will be created with the contents of the returned object. So, it will be a new object (made with the data from the returned one), and will be filtered by the cloned response_model , containing only the declared fields as normally. PR #322 .

For example: async def get_database (): with Session () as session : try : yield session except HTTPException : session . rollback () raise finally : session . close () After the dependency with yield handles the exception (or not) the exception is raised again. So that any exception handlers can catch it, or ultimately the default internal ServerErrorMiddleware . If you depended on exceptions not being received by dependencies with yield , and receiving an exception breaks the code after yield , you can use a block with try and finally : async def do_something (): try : yield something finally : some_cleanup () ...that way the finally block is run regardless of any exception that might happen.","title":"Breaking Changes"},{"location":"release-notes/#features_3","text":"The same PR #4575 from above also fixes the contextvars context for the code before and after yield . This was the main objective of that PR. This means that now, if you set a value in a context variable before yield , the value would still be available after yield (as you would intuitively expect). And it also means that you can reset the context variable with a token afterwards. For example, this works correctly now: from contextvars import ContextVar from typing import Any , Dict , Optional legacy_request_state_context_var : ContextVar [ Optional [ Dict [ str , Any ]]] = ContextVar ( \"legacy_request_state_context_var\" , default = None ) async def set_up_request_state_dependency (): request_state = { \"user\" : \"deadpond\" } contextvar_token = legacy_request_state_context_var . set ( request_state ) yield request_state legacy_request_state_context_var . reset ( contextvar_token ) ...before this change it would raise an error when resetting the context variable, because the contextvars context was different, because of the way it was implemented. Note : You probably don't need contextvars , and you should probably avoid using them. But they are powerful and useful in some advanced scenarios, for example, migrating from code that used Flask's g semi-global variable.

Initial PR #2118 by @patrickkwang . This change fixes a CSRF security vulnerability when using cookies for authentication in path operations with JSON payloads sent by browsers. In versions lower than 0.65.2 , FastAPI would try to read the request payload as JSON even if the content-type header sent was not set to application/json or a compatible JSON media type (e.g. application/geo+json ). So, a request with a content type of text/plain containing JSON data would be accepted and the JSON data would be extracted. But requests with content type text/plain are exempt from CORS preflights, for being considered Simple requests . So, the browser would execute them right away including cookies, and the text content could be a JSON string that would be parsed and accepted by the FastAPI application.

PR #2434 by @tiangolo . Up to now, for several options, the only way to apply them to a group of path operations was in include_router . That works well, but the call to app.include_router() or router.include_router() is normally done in another file. That means that, for example, to apply authentication to all the path operations in a router it would end up being done in a different file, instead of keeping related logic together. Setting options in include_router still makes sense in some cases, for example, to override or increase configurations from a third party router included in an app. But in a router that is part of a bigger application, it would probably make more sense to add those settings when creating the APIRouter . In FastAPI This allows setting the (mostly new) parameters (additionally to the already existing parameters): default_response_class : updated to handle defaults in APIRouter and include_router . dependencies : to include \u2728 top-level dependencies \u2728 that apply to the whole application. E.g. to add global authentication. callbacks : OpenAPI callbacks that apply to all the path operations . deprecated : to mark all the path operations as deprecated. \ud83e\udd37 include_in_schema : to allow excluding all the path operations from the OpenAPI schema. responses : OpenAPI responses that apply to all the path operations . For example: from fastapi import FastAPI , Depends async def some_dependency (): return app = FastAPI ( dependencies = [ Depends ( some_dependency )]) In APIRouter This allows setting the (mostly new) parameters (additionally to the already existing parameters): default_response_class : updated to handle defaults in APIRouter and include_router . For example, it's not needed to set it explicitly when creating callbacks . dependencies : to include \u2728 router-level dependencies \u2728 that apply to all the path operations in a router. Up to now, this was only possible with include_router . callbacks : OpenAPI callbacks that apply to all the path operations in this router. deprecated : to mark all the path operations in a router as deprecated. include_in_schema : to allow excluding all the path operations in a router from the OpenAPI schema. responses : OpenAPI responses that apply to all the path operations in a router. prefix : to set the path prefix for a router. Up to now, this was only possible when calling include_router . tags : OpenAPI tags to apply to all the path operations in this router. For example: from fastapi import APIRouter , Depends async def some_dependency (): return router = APIRouter ( prefix = \"/users\" , dependencies = [ Depends ( some_dependency )]) In include_router Most of these settings are now supported in APIRouter , which normally lives closer to the related code, so it is recommended to use APIRouter when possible. But include_router is still useful to, for example, adding options (like dependencies , prefix , and tags ) when including a third party router, or a generic router that is shared between several projects. This PR allows setting the (mostly new) parameters (additionally to the already existing parameters): default_response_class : updated to handle defaults in APIRouter and FastAPI . deprecated : to mark all the path operations in a router as deprecated in OpenAPI. include_in_schema : to allow disabling all the path operations from showing in the OpenAPI schema. callbacks : OpenAPI callbacks that apply to all the path operations in this router.

If you have advanced custom logic to access each route's route.response_class , or the router.default_response_class , or the app.default_response_class : the default value for response_class in APIRoute and for default_response_class in APIRouter and FastAPI is now a DefaultPlaceholder used internally to handle and solve default values and overrides.

New docs: SQL (Relational) Databases . The new support for ORM mode fixes issues/adds features related to ORMs with lazy-loading, hybrid properties, dynamic/getters (using @property decorators) and several other use cases. This applies to ORMs like SQLAlchemy, Peewee, Tortoise ORM, GINO ORM and virtually any other. If your path operations return an arbitrary object with attributes (e.g. my_item.name instead of my_item[\"name\"] ) AND you use a response_model , make sure to update the Pydantic models with orm_mode = True as described in the docs (link above). New documentation about receiving plain dict s as request bodies: Bodies of arbitrary dict s . New documentation about returning arbitrary dict s in responses: Response with arbitrary dict . Technical Details : When declaring a response_model it is used directly to generate the response content, from whatever was returned from the path operation function . Before this, the return content was first passed through jsonable_encoder to ensure it was a \"jsonable\" object, like a dict , instead of an arbitrary object with attributes (like an ORM model). That's why you should make sure to update your Pydantic models for objects with attributes to use orm_mode = True . If you don't have a response_model , the return object will still be passed through jsonable_encoder first. When a response_model is declared, the same response_model type declaration won't be used as is, it will be \"cloned\" to create an new one (a cloned Pydantic Field with all the submodels cloned as well). This avoids/fixes a potential security issue: as the returned object is passed directly to Pydantic, if the returned object was a subclass of the response_model (e.g. you return a UserInDB that inherits from User but contains extra fields, like hashed_password , and User is used in the response_model ), it would still pass the validation (because UserInDB is a subclass of User ) and the object would be returned as-is, including the hashed_password . To fix this, the declared response_model is cloned, if it is a Pydantic model class (or contains Pydantic model classes in it, e.g. in a List[Item] ), the Pydantic model class(es) will be a different one (the \"cloned\" one). So, an object that is a subclass won't simply pass the validation and returned as-is, because it is no longer a sub-class of the cloned response_model . Instead, a new Pydantic model object will be created with the contents of the returned object. So, it will be a new object (made with the data from the returned one), and will be filtered by the cloned response_model , containing only the declared fields as normally. PR #322 .

But you can help translating it: Contributing . Warning This is a rather advanced topic. If you are starting with FastAPI , you might not need this. You can declare additional responses, with additional status codes, media types, descriptions, etc. Those additional responses will be included in the OpenAPI schema, so they will also appear in the API docs. But for those additional responses you have to make sure you return a Response like JSONResponse directly, with your status code and content. Additional Response with model \u00b6 You can pass to your path operation decorators a parameter responses . It receives a dict , the keys are status codes for each response, like 200 , and the values are other dict s with the information for each of them. Each of those response dict s can have a key model , containing a Pydantic model, just like response_model . FastAPI will take that model, generate its JSON Schema and include it in the correct place in OpenAPI. For example, to declare another response with a status code 404 and a Pydantic model Message , you can write: from fastapi import FastAPI from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse from pydantic import BaseModel class Item ( BaseModel ): id : str value : str class Message ( BaseModel ): message : str app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" , response_model = Item , responses = { 404 : { \"model\" : Message }}) async def read_item ( item_id : str ): if item_id == \"foo\" : return { \"id\" : \"foo\" , \"value\" : \"there goes my hero\" } else : return JSONResponse ( status_code = 404 , content = { \"message\" : \"Item not found\" }) Note Have in mind that you have to return the JSONResponse directly. Info The model key is not part of OpenAPI. FastAPI will take the Pydantic model from there, generate the JSON Schema , and put it in the correct place. The correct place is: In the key content , that has as value another JSON object ( dict ) that contains: A key with the media type, e.g. application/json , that contains as value another JSON object, that contains: A key schema , that has as the value the JSON Schema from the model, here's the correct place. FastAPI adds a reference here to the global JSON Schemas in another place in your OpenAPI instead of including it directly. This way, other applications and clients can use those JSON Schemas directly, provide better code generation tools, etc. The generated responses in the OpenAPI for this path operation will be: { \"responses\" : { \"404\" : { \"description\" : \"Additional Response\" , \"content\" : { \"application/json\" : { \"schema\" : { \"$ref\" : \"#/components/schemas/Message\" } } } }, \"200\" : { \"description\" : \"Successful Response\" , \"content\" : { \"application/json\" : { \"schema\" : { \"$ref\" : \"#/components/schemas/Item\" } } } }, \"422\" : { \"description\" : \"Validation Error\" , \"content\" : { \"application/json\" : { \"schema\" : { \"$ref\" : \"#/components/schemas/HTTPValidationError\" } } } } } } The schemas are referenced to another place inside the OpenAPI schema: { \"components\" : { \"schemas\" : { \"Message\" : { \"title\" : \"Message\" , \"required\" : [ \"message\" ], \"type\" : \"object\" , \"properties\" : { \"message\" : { \"title\" : \"Message\" , \"type\" : \"string\" } } }, \"Item\" : { \"title\" : \"Item\" , \"required\" : [ \"id\" , \"value\" ], \"type\" : \"object\" , \"properties\" : { \"id\" : { \"title\" : \"Id\" , \"type\" : \"string\" }, \"value\" : { \"title\" : \"Value\" , \"type\" : \"string\" } } }, \"ValidationError\" : { \"title\" : \"ValidationError\" , \"required\" : [ \"loc\" , \"msg\" , \"type\" ], \"type\" : \"object\" , \"properties\" : { \"loc\" : { \"title\" : \"Location\" , \"type\" : \"array\" , \"items\" : { \"type\" : \"string\" } }, \"msg\" : { \"title\" : \"Message\" , \"type\" : \"string\" }, \"type\" : { \"title\" : \"Error Type\" , \"type\" : \"string\" } } }, \"HTTPValidationError\" : { \"title\" : \"HTTPValidationError\" , \"type\" : \"object\" , \"properties\" : { \"detail\" : { \"title\" : \"Detail\" , \"type\" : \"array\" , \"items\" : { \"$ref\" : \"#/components/schemas/ValidationError\" } } } } } } } Additional media types for the main response \u00b6 You can use this same responses parameter to add different media types for the same main response. For example, you can add an additional media type of image/png , declaring that your path operation can return a JSON object (with media type application/json ) or a PNG image: from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI from fastapi.responses import FileResponse from pydantic import BaseModel class Item ( BaseModel ): id : str value : str app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" , response_model = Item , responses = { 200 : { \"content\" : { \"image/png\" : {}}, \"description\" : \"Return the JSON item or an image.\" , } }, ) async def read_item ( item_id : str , img : Union [ bool , None ] = None ): if img : return FileResponse ( \"image.png\" , media_type = \"image/png\" ) else : return { \"id\" : \"foo\" , \"value\" : \"there goes my hero\" } Note Notice that you have to return the image using a FileResponse directly. Info Unless you specify a different media type explicitly in your responses parameter, FastAPI will assume the response has the same media type as the main response class (default application/json ). But if you have specified a custom response class with None as its media type, FastAPI will use application/json for any additional response that has an associated model. Combining information \u00b6 You can also combine response information from multiple places, including the response_model , status_code , and responses parameters. You can declare a response_model , using the default status code 200 (or a custom one if you need), and then declare additional information for that same response in responses , directly in the OpenAPI schema. FastAPI will keep the additional information from responses , and combine it with the JSON Schema from your model. For example, you can declare a response with a status code 404 that uses a Pydantic model and has a custom description . And a response with a status code 200 that uses your response_model , but includes a custom example : from fastapi import FastAPI from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse from pydantic import BaseModel class Item ( BaseModel ): id : str value : str class Message ( BaseModel ): message : str app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" , response_model = Item , responses = { 404 : { \"model\" : Message , \"description\" : \"The item was not found\" }, 200 : { \"description\" : \"Item requested by ID\" , \"content\" : { \"application/json\" : { \"example\" : { \"id\" : \"bar\" , \"value\" : \"The bar tenders\" } } }, }, }, ) async def read_item ( item_id : str ): if item_id == \"foo\" : return { \"id\" : \"foo\" , \"value\" : \"there goes my hero\" } else : return JSONResponse ( status_code = 404 , content = { \"message\" : \"Item not found\" }) It will all be combined and included in your OpenAPI, and shown in the API docs: Combine predefined responses and custom ones \u00b6 You might want to have some predefined responses that apply to many path operations , but you want to combine them with custom responses needed by each path operation . For those cases, you can use the Python technique of \"unpacking\" a dict with **dict_to_unpack : old_dict = { \"old key\" : \"old value\" , \"second old key\" : \"second old value\" , } new_dict = { ** old_dict , \"new key\" : \"new value\" } Here, new_dict will contain all the key-value pairs from old_dict plus the new key-value pair: { \"old key\" : \"old value\" , \"second old key\" : \"second old value\" , \"new key\" : \"new value\" , } You can use that technique to re-use some predefined responses in your path operations and combine them with additional custom ones. For example: from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI from fastapi.responses import FileResponse from pydantic import BaseModel class Item ( BaseModel ): id : str value : str responses = { 404 : { \"description\" : \"Item not found\" }, 302 : { \"description\" : \"The item was moved\" }, 403 : { \"description\" : \"Not enough privileges\" }, } app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" , response_model = Item , responses = { ** responses , 200 : { \"content\" : { \"image/png\" : {}}}}, ) async def read_item ( item_id : str , img : Union [ bool , None ] = None ): if img : return FileResponse ( \"image.png\" , media_type = \"image/png\" ) else : return { \"id\" : \"foo\" , \"value\" : \"there goes my hero\" } More information about OpenAPI responses \u00b6 To see what exactly you can include in the responses, you can check these sections in the OpenAPI specification: OpenAPI Responses Object , it includes the Response Object .

But you can help translating it: Contributing . Parameterized dependencies \u00b6 All the dependencies we have seen are a fixed function or class. But there could be cases where you want to be able to set parameters on the dependency, without having to declare many different functions or classes. Let's imagine that we want to have a dependency that checks if the query parameter q contains some fixed content. But we want to be able to parameterize that fixed content. A \"callable\" instance \u00b6 In Python there's a way to make an instance of a class a \"callable\". Not the class itself (which is already a callable), but an instance of that class. To do that, we declare a method __call__ : from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI app = FastAPI () class FixedContentQueryChecker : def __init__ ( self , fixed_content : str ): self . fixed_content = fixed_content def __call__ ( self , q : str = \"\" ): if q : return self . fixed_content in q return False checker = FixedContentQueryChecker ( \"bar\" ) @app . get ( \"/query-checker/\" ) async def read_query_check ( fixed_content_included : bool = Depends ( checker )): return { \"fixed_content_in_query\" : fixed_content_included } In this case, this __call__ is what FastAPI will use to check for additional parameters and sub-dependencies, and this is what will be called to pass a value to the parameter in your path operation function later. Parameterize the instance \u00b6 And now, we can use __init__ to declare the parameters of the instance that we can use to \"parameterize\" the dependency: from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI app = FastAPI () class FixedContentQueryChecker : def __init__ ( self , fixed_content : str ): self . fixed_content = fixed_content def __call__ ( self , q : str = \"\" ): if q : return self . fixed_content in q return False checker = FixedContentQueryChecker ( \"bar\" ) @app . get ( \"/query-checker/\" ) async def read_query_check ( fixed_content_included : bool = Depends ( checker )): return { \"fixed_content_in_query\" : fixed_content_included } In this case, FastAPI won't ever touch or care about __init__ , we will use it directly in our code.

Let's look at how we can make that work. pytest.mark.anyio \u00b6 If we want to call asynchronous functions in our tests, our test functions have to be asynchronous. Anyio provides a neat plugin for this, that allows us to specify that some test functions are to be called asynchronously. HTTPX \u00b6 Even if your FastAPI application uses normal def functions instead of async def , it is still an async application underneath. The TestClient does some magic inside to call the asynchronous FastAPI application in your normal def test functions, using standard pytest. But that magic doesn't work anymore when we're using it inside asynchronous functions. By running our tests asynchronously, we can no longer use the TestClient inside our test functions. Luckily there's a nice alternative, called HTTPX . HTTPX is an HTTP client for Python 3 that allows us to query our FastAPI application similarly to how we did it with the TestClient . If you're familiar with the Requests library, you'll find that the API of HTTPX is almost identical. The important difference for us is that with HTTPX we are not limited to synchronous, but can also make asynchronous requests.

But you can help translating it: Contributing . In some situations, you might need to use a proxy server like Traefik or Nginx with a configuration that adds an extra path prefix that is not seen by your application. In these cases you can use root_path to configure your application. The root_path is a mechanism provided by the ASGI specification (that FastAPI is built on, through Starlette). The root_path is used to handle these specific cases. And it's also used internally when mounting sub-applications. Proxy with a stripped path prefix \u00b6 Having a proxy with a stripped path prefix, in this case, means that you could declare a path at /app in your code, but then, you add a layer on top (the proxy) that would put your FastAPI application under a path like /api/v1 . In this case, the original path /app would actually be served at /api/v1/app . Even though all your code is written assuming there's just /app . And the proxy would be \"stripping\" the path prefix on the fly before transmitting the request to Uvicorn, keep your application convinced that it is serving at /app , so that you don't have to update all your code to include the prefix /api/v1 . Up to here, everything would work as normally. But then, when you open the integrated docs UI (the frontend), it would expect to get the OpenAPI schema at /openapi.json , instead of /api/v1/openapi.json . So, the frontend (that runs in the browser) would try to reach /openapi.json and wouldn't be able to get the OpenAPI schema. Because we have a proxy with a path prefix of /api/v1 for our app, the frontend needs to fetch the OpenAPI schema at /api/v1/openapi.json . graph LR browser(\"Browser\") proxy[\"Proxy on http://0.0.0.0:9999/api/v1/app\"] server[\"Server on http://127.0.0.1:8000/app\"] browser --> proxy proxy --> server Tip The IP 0.0.0.0 is commonly used to mean that the program listens on all the IPs available in that machine/server. The docs UI would also need the OpenAPI schema to declare that this API server is located at /api/v1 (behind the proxy). For example: { \"openapi\" : \"3.0.2\" , // More stuff here \"servers\" : [ { \"url\" : \"/api/v1\" } ], \"paths\" : { // More stuff here } } In this example, the \"Proxy\" could be something like Traefik . And the server would be something like Uvicorn , running your FastAPI application. Providing the root_path \u00b6 To achieve this, you can use the command line option --root-path like: $ uvicorn main:app --root-path /api/v1 <span style=\"color: green;\">INFO</span>: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit) If you use Hypercorn, it also has the option --root-path . Technical Details The ASGI specification defines a root_path for this use case. And the --root-path command line option provides that root_path . Checking the current root_path \u00b6 You can get the current root_path used by your application for each request, it is part of the scope dictionary (that's part of the ASGI spec). Here we are including it in the message just for demonstration purposes. from fastapi import FastAPI , Request app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/app\" ) def read_main ( request : Request ): return { \"message\" : \"Hello World\" , \"root_path\" : request . scope . get ( \"root_path\" )} Then, if you start Uvicorn with: $ uvicorn main:app --root-path /api/v1 <span style=\"color: green;\">INFO</span>: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit) The response would be something like: { \"message\" : \"Hello World\" , \"root_path\" : \"/api/v1\" } Setting the root_path in the FastAPI app \u00b6 Alternatively, if you don't have a way to provide a command line option like --root-path or equivalent, you can set the root_path parameter when creating your FastAPI app: from fastapi import FastAPI , Request app = FastAPI ( root_path = \"/api/v1\" ) @app . get ( \"/app\" ) def read_main ( request : Request ): return { \"message\" : \"Hello World\" , \"root_path\" : request . scope . get ( \"root_path\" )} Passing the root_path to FastAPI would be the equivalent of passing the --root-path command line option to Uvicorn or Hypercorn. About root_path \u00b6 Have in mind that the server (Uvicorn) won't use that root_path for anything else than passing it to the app. But if you go with your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8000/app you will see the normal response: { \"message\" : \"Hello World\" , \"root_path\" : \"/api/v1\" } So, it won't expect to be accessed at http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/app . Uvicorn will expect the proxy to access Uvicorn at http://127.0.0.1:8000/app , and then it would be the proxy's responsibility to add the extra /api/v1 prefix on top. About proxies with a stripped path prefix \u00b6 Have in mind that a proxy with stripped path prefix is only one of the ways to configure it. Probably in many cases the default will be that the proxy doesn't have a stripped path prefix. In a case like that (without a stripped path prefix), the proxy would listen on something like https://myawesomeapp.com , and then if the browser goes to https://myawesomeapp.com/api/v1/app and your server (e.g. Uvicorn) listens on http://127.0.0.1:8000 the proxy (without a stripped path prefix) would access Uvicorn at the same path: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/app . Testing locally with Traefik \u00b6 You can easily run the experiment locally with a stripped path prefix using Traefik . Download Traefik , it's a single binary, you can extract the compressed file and run it directly from the terminal. Then create a file traefik.toml with: [entryPoints] [entryPoints.http] address = \":9999\" [providers] [providers.file] filename = \"routes.toml\" This tells Traefik to listen on port 9999 and to use another file routes.toml . Tip We are using port 9999 instead of the standard HTTP port 80 so that you don't have to run it with admin ( sudo ) privileges. Now create that other file routes.toml : [http] [http.middlewares] [http.middlewares.api-stripprefix.stripPrefix] prefixes = [ \"/api/v1\" ] [http.routers] [http.routers.app-http] entryPoints = [ \"http\" ] service = \"app\" rule = \"PathPrefix(`/api/v1`)\" middlewares = [ \"api-stripprefix\" ] [http.services] [http.services.app] [http.services.app.loadBalancer] [[http.services.app.loadBalancer.servers]] url = \"http://127.0.0.1:8000\" This file configures Traefik to use the path prefix /api/v1 . And then it will redirect its requests to your Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 . Now start Traefik: $ ./traefik --configFile = traefik.toml INFO[0000] Configuration loaded from file: /home/user/awesomeapi/traefik.toml And now start your app with Uvicorn, using the --root-path option: $ uvicorn main:app --root-path /api/v1 <span style=\"color: green;\">INFO</span>: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit) Check the responses \u00b6 Now, if you go to the URL with the port for Uvicorn: http://127.0.0.1:8000/app , you will see the normal response: { \"message\" : \"Hello World\" , \"root_path\" : \"/api/v1\" } Tip Notice that even though you are accessing it at http://127.0.0.1:8000/app it shows the root_path of /api/v1 , taken from the option --root-path . And now open the URL with the port for Traefik, including the path prefix: http://127.0.0.1:9999/api/v1/app . We get the same response: { \"message\" : \"Hello World\" , \"root_path\" : \"/api/v1\" } but this time at the URL with the prefix path provided by the proxy: /api/v1 . Of course, the idea here is that everyone would access the app through the proxy, so the version with the path prefix /app/v1 is the \"correct\" one. And the version without the path prefix ( http://127.0.0.1:8000/app ), provided by Uvicorn directly, would be exclusively for the proxy (Traefik) to access it. That demonstrates how the Proxy (Traefik) uses the path prefix and how the server (Uvicorn) uses the root_path from the option --root-path . Check the docs UI \u00b6 But here's the fun part. \u2728 The \"official\" way to access the app would be through the proxy with the path prefix that we defined. So, as we would expect, if you try the docs UI served by Uvicorn directly, without the path prefix in the URL, it won't work, because it expects to be accessed through the proxy. You can check it at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs : But if we access the docs UI at the \"official\" URL using the proxy with port 9999 , at /api/v1/docs , it works correctly! \ud83c\udf89 You can check it at http://127.0.0.1:9999/api/v1/docs : Right as we wanted it. \u2714\ufe0f This is because FastAPI uses this root_path to create the default server in OpenAPI with the URL provided by root_path . Additional servers \u00b6 Warning This is a more advanced use case. Feel free to skip it. By default, FastAPI will create a server in the OpenAPI schema with the URL for the root_path . But you can also provide other alternative servers , for example if you want the same docs UI to interact with a staging and production environments. If you pass a custom list of servers and there's a root_path (because your API lives behind a proxy), FastAPI will insert a \"server\" with this root_path at the beginning of the list. For example: from fastapi import FastAPI , Request app = FastAPI ( servers = [ { \"url\" : \"https://stag.example.com\" , \"description\" : \"Staging environment\" }, { \"url\" : \"https://prod.example.com\" , \"description\" : \"Production environment\" }, ], root_path = \"/api/v1\" , ) @app . get ( \"/app\" ) def read_main ( request : Request ): return { \"message\" : \"Hello World\" , \"root_path\" : request . scope . get ( \"root_path\" )} Will generate an OpenAPI schema like: { \"openapi\" : \"3.0.2\" , // More stuff here \"servers\" : [ { \"url\" : \"/api/v1\" }, { \"url\" : \"https://stag.example.com\" , \"description\" : \"Staging environment\" }, { \"url\" : \"https://prod.example.com\" , \"description\" : \"Production environment\" } ], \"paths\" : { // More stuff here } } Tip Notice the auto-generated server with a url value of /api/v1 , taken from the root_path . In the docs UI at http://127.0.0.1:9999/api/v1/docs it would look like: Tip The docs UI will interact with the server that you select. Disable automatic server from root_path \u00b6 If you don't want FastAPI to include an automatic server using the root_path , you can use the parameter root_path_in_servers=False : from fastapi import FastAPI , Request app = FastAPI ( servers = [ { \"url\" : \"https://stag.example.com\" , \"description\" : \"Staging environment\" }, { \"url\" : \"https://prod.example.com\" , \"description\" : \"Production environment\" }, ], root_path = \"/api/v1\" , root_path_in_servers = False , ) @app . get ( \"/app\" ) def read_main ( request : Request ): return { \"message\" : \"Hello World\" , \"root_path\" : request . scope . get ( \"root_path\" )} and then it won't include it in the OpenAPI schema. Mounting a sub-application \u00b6 If you need to mount a sub-application (as described in Sub Applications - Mounts ) while also using a proxy with root_path , you can do it normally, as you would expect. FastAPI will internally use the root_path smartly, so it will just work. \u2728","title":"Behind a Proxy"},{"location":"advanced/behind-a-proxy/#behind-a-proxy","text":"Warning The current page still doesn't have a translation for this language.

And then it will redirect its requests to your Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 . Now start Traefik: $ ./traefik --configFile = traefik.toml INFO[0000] Configuration loaded from file: /home/user/awesomeapi/traefik.toml And now start your app with Uvicorn, using the --root-path option: $ uvicorn main:app --root-path /api/v1 <span style=\"color: green;\">INFO</span>: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)","title":"Testing locally with Traefik"},{"location":"advanced/behind-a-proxy/#check-the-responses","text":"Now, if you go to the URL with the port for Uvicorn: http://127.0.0.1:8000/app , you will see the normal response: { \"message\" : \"Hello World\" , \"root_path\" : \"/api/v1\" } Tip Notice that even though you are accessing it at http://127.0.0.1:8000/app it shows the root_path of /api/v1 , taken from the option --root-path .

And the version without the path prefix ( http://127.0.0.1:8000/app ), provided by Uvicorn directly, would be exclusively for the proxy (Traefik) to access it.

Danger This is an \"advanced\" feature. If you are just starting with FastAPI you might want to skip this section. Use cases \u00b6 Some use cases include: Converting non-JSON request bodies to JSON (e.g. msgpack ). Decompressing gzip-compressed request bodies. Automatically logging all request bodies. Handling custom request body encodings \u00b6 Let's see how to make use of a custom Request subclass to decompress gzip requests. And an APIRoute subclass to use that custom request class. Create a custom GzipRequest class \u00b6 Tip This is a toy example to demonstrate how it works, if you need Gzip support, you can use the provided GzipMiddleware . First, we create a GzipRequest class, which will overwrite the Request.body() method to decompress the body in the presence of an appropriate header. If there's no gzip in the header, it will not try to decompress the body. That way, the same route class can handle gzip compressed or uncompressed requests. import gzip from typing import Callable , List from fastapi import Body , FastAPI , Request , Response from fastapi.routing import APIRoute class GzipRequest ( Request ): async def body ( self ) -> bytes : if not hasattr ( self , \"_body\" ): body = await super () . body () if \"gzip\" in self . headers . getlist ( \"Content-Encoding\" ): body = gzip . decompress ( body ) self . _body = body return self . _body class GzipRoute ( APIRoute ): def get_route_handler ( self ) -> Callable : original_route_handler = super () . get_route_handler () async def custom_route_handler ( request : Request ) -> Response : request = GzipRequest ( request . scope , request . receive ) return await original_route_handler ( request ) return custom_route_handler app = FastAPI () app . router . route_class = GzipRoute @app . post ( \"/sum\" ) async def sum_numbers ( numbers : List [ int ] = Body ()): return { \"sum\" : sum ( numbers )} Create a custom GzipRoute class \u00b6 Next, we create a custom subclass of fastapi.routing.APIRoute that will make use of the GzipRequest . This time, it will overwrite the method APIRoute.get_route_handler() . This method returns a function. And that function is what will receive a request and return a response. Here we use it to create a GzipRequest from the original request. import gzip from typing import Callable , List from fastapi import Body , FastAPI , Request , Response from fastapi.routing import APIRoute class GzipRequest ( Request ): async def body ( self ) -> bytes : if not hasattr ( self , \"_body\" ): body = await super () . body () if \"gzip\" in self . headers . getlist ( \"Content-Encoding\" ): body = gzip . decompress ( body ) self . _body = body return self . _body class GzipRoute ( APIRoute ): def get_route_handler ( self ) -> Callable : original_route_handler = super () . get_route_handler () async def custom_route_handler ( request : Request ) -> Response : request = GzipRequest ( request . scope , request . receive ) return await original_route_handler ( request ) return custom_route_handler app = FastAPI () app . router . route_class = GzipRoute @app . post ( \"/sum\" ) async def sum_numbers ( numbers : List [ int ] = Body ()): return { \"sum\" : sum ( numbers )} Technical Details A Request has a request.scope attribute, that's just a Python dict containing the metadata related to the request. A Request also has a request.receive , that's a function to \"receive\" the body of the request. The scope dict and receive function are both part of the ASGI specification. And those two things, scope and receive , are what is needed to create a new Request instance. To learn more about the Request check Starlette's docs about Requests . The only thing the function returned by GzipRequest.get_route_handler does differently is convert the Request to a GzipRequest . Doing this, our GzipRequest will take care of decompressing the data (if necessary) before passing it to our path operations . After that, all of the processing logic is the same. But because of our changes in GzipRequest.body , the request body will be automatically decompressed when it is loaded by FastAPI when needed. Accessing the request body in an exception handler \u00b6 Tip To solve this same problem, it's probably a lot easier to use the body in a custom handler for RequestValidationError ( Handling Errors ). But this example is still valid and it shows how to interact with the internal components. We can also use this same approach to access the request body in an exception handler.

Pass HTMLResponse as the parameter response_class of your path operation decorator . from fastapi import FastAPI from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" , response_class = HTMLResponse ) async def read_items (): return \"\"\" <html> <head> <title>Some HTML in here</title> </head> <body> <h1>Look ma! HTML!</h1> </body> </html> \"\"\" Info The parameter response_class will also be used to define the \"media type\" of the response. In this case, the HTTP header Content-Type will be set to text/html . And it will be documented as such in OpenAPI. Return a Response \u00b6 As seen in Return a Response directly , you can also override the response directly in your path operation , by returning it. The same example from above, returning an HTMLResponse , could look like: from fastapi import FastAPI from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items (): html_content = \"\"\" <html> <head> <title>Some HTML in here</title> </head> <body> <h1>Look ma! HTML!</h1> </body> </html> \"\"\" return HTMLResponse ( content = html_content , status_code = 200 ) Warning A Response returned directly by your path operation function won't be documented in OpenAPI (for example, the Content-Type won't be documented) and won't be visible in the automatic interactive docs. Info Of course, the actual Content-Type header, status code, etc, will come from the Response object your returned. Document in OpenAPI and override Response \u00b6 If you want to override the response from inside of the function but at the same time document the \"media type\" in OpenAPI, you can use the response_class parameter AND return a Response object. The response_class will then be used only to document the OpenAPI path operation , but your Response will be used as is. Return an HTMLResponse directly \u00b6 For example, it could be something like: from fastapi import FastAPI from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse app = FastAPI () def generate_html_response (): html_content = \"\"\" <html> <head> <title>Some HTML in here</title> </head> <body> <h1>Look ma! HTML!</h1> </body> </html> \"\"\" return HTMLResponse ( content = html_content , status_code = 200 ) @app . get ( \"/items/\" , response_class = HTMLResponse ) async def read_items (): return generate_html_response () In this example, the function generate_html_response() already generates and returns a Response instead of returning the HTML in a str . By returning the result of calling generate_html_response() , you are already returning a Response that will override the default FastAPI behavior. But as you passed the HTMLResponse in the response_class too, FastAPI will know how to document it in OpenAPI and the interactive docs as HTML with text/html : Available responses \u00b6 Here are some of the available responses. Have in mind that you can use Response to return anything else, or even create a custom sub-class. Technical Details You could also use from starlette.responses import HTMLResponse . FastAPI provides the same starlette.responses as fastapi.responses just as a convenience for you, the developer. But most of the available responses come directly from Starlette. Response \u00b6 The main Response class, all the other responses inherit from it. You can return it directly. It accepts the following parameters: content - A str or bytes . status_code - An int HTTP status code. headers - A dict of strings. media_type - A str giving the media type. E.g. \"text/html\" . FastAPI (actually Starlette) will automatically include a Content-Length header. It will also include a Content-Type header, based on the media_type and appending a charset for text types. from fastapi import FastAPI , Response app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/legacy/\" ) def get_legacy_data (): data = \"\"\"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?> <shampoo> <Header> Apply shampoo here. </Header> <Body> You'll have to use soap here. </Body> </shampoo> \"\"\" return Response ( content = data , media_type = \"application/xml\" ) HTMLResponse \u00b6 Takes some text or bytes and returns an HTML response, as you read above. PlainTextResponse \u00b6 Takes some text or bytes and returns an plain text response. from fastapi import FastAPI from fastapi.responses import PlainTextResponse app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/\" , response_class = PlainTextResponse ) async def main (): return \"Hello World\" JSONResponse \u00b6 Takes some data and returns an application/json encoded response. This is the default response used in FastAPI , as you read above. ORJSONResponse \u00b6 A fast alternative JSON response using orjson , as you read above. UJSONResponse \u00b6 An alternative JSON response using ujson . Warning ujson is less careful than Python's built-in implementation in how it handles some edge-cases. from fastapi import FastAPI from fastapi.responses import UJSONResponse app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" , response_class = UJSONResponse ) async def read_items (): return [{ \"item_id\" : \"Foo\" }] Tip It's possible that ORJSONResponse might be a faster alternative. RedirectResponse \u00b6 Returns an HTTP redirect. Uses a 307 status code (Temporary Redirect) by default. You can return a RedirectResponse directly: from fastapi import FastAPI from fastapi.responses import RedirectResponse app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/typer\" ) async def redirect_typer (): return RedirectResponse ( \"https://typer.tiangolo.com\" ) Or you can use it in the response_class parameter: from fastapi import FastAPI from fastapi.responses import RedirectResponse app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/fastapi\" , response_class = RedirectResponse ) async def redirect_fastapi (): return \"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com\" If you do that, then you can return the URL directly from your path operation function. In this case, the status_code used will be the default one for the RedirectResponse , which is 307 . You can also use the status_code parameter combined with the response_class parameter: from fastapi import FastAPI from fastapi.responses import RedirectResponse app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/pydantic\" , response_class = RedirectResponse , status_code = 302 ) async def redirect_pydantic (): return \"https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/\" StreamingResponse \u00b6 Takes an async generator or a normal generator/iterator and streams the response body. from fastapi import FastAPI from fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse app = FastAPI () async def fake_video_streamer (): for i in range ( 10 ): yield b \"some fake video bytes\" @app . get ( \"/\" ) async def main (): return StreamingResponse ( fake_video_streamer ()) Using StreamingResponse with file-like objects \u00b6 If you have a file-like object (e.g. the object returned by open() ), you can create a generator function to iterate over that file-like object. That way, you don't have to read it all first in memory, and you can pass that generator function to the StreamingResponse , and return it. This includes many libraries to interact with cloud storage, video processing, and others. from fastapi import FastAPI from fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse some_file_path = \"large-video-file.mp4\" app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/\" ) def main (): def iterfile (): # (1) with open ( some_file_path , mode = \"rb\" ) as file_like : # (2) yield from file_like # (3) return StreamingResponse ( iterfile (), media_type = \"video/mp4\" ) This is the generator function. It's a \"generator function\" because it contains yield statements inside. By using a with block, we make sure that the file-like object is closed after the generator function is done. So, after it finishes sending the response. This yield from tells the function to iterate over that thing named file_like . And then, for each part iterated, yield that part as coming from this generator function. So, it is a generator function that transfers the \"generating\" work to something else internally. By doing it this way, we can put it in a with block, and that way, ensure that it is closed after finishing. Tip Notice that here as we are using standard open() that doesn't support async and await , we declare the path operation with normal def . FileResponse \u00b6 Asynchronously streams a file as the response. Takes a different set of arguments to instantiate than the other response types: path - The filepath to the file to stream. headers - Any custom headers to include, as a dictionary. media_type - A string giving the media type. If unset, the filename or path will be used to infer a media type. filename - If set, this will be included in the response Content-Disposition . File responses will include appropriate Content-Length , Last-Modified and ETag headers. from fastapi import FastAPI from fastapi.responses import FileResponse some_file_path = \"large-video-file.mp4\" app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/\" ) async def main (): return FileResponse ( some_file_path ) You can also use the response_class parameter: from fastapi import FastAPI from fastapi.responses import FileResponse some_file_path = \"large-video-file.mp4\" app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/\" , response_class = FileResponse ) async def main (): return some_file_path In this case, you can return the file path directly from your path operation function. Default response class \u00b6 When creating a FastAPI class instance or an APIRouter you can specify which response class to use by default. The parameter that defines this is default_response_class . In the example below, FastAPI will use ORJSONResponse by default, in all path operations , instead of JSONResponse . from fastapi import FastAPI from fastapi.responses import ORJSONResponse app = FastAPI ( default_response_class = ORJSONResponse ) @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items (): return [{ \"item_id\" : \"Foo\" }] Tip You can still override response_class in path operations as before.

This way, its schema will show up in the API docs user interface: Dataclasses in Nested Data Structures \u00b6 You can also combine dataclasses with other type annotations to make nested data structures. In some cases, you might still have to use Pydantic's version of dataclasses . For example, if you have errors with the automatically generated API documentation. In that case, you can simply swap the standard dataclasses with pydantic.dataclasses , which is a drop-in replacement: from dataclasses import field # (1) from typing import List , Union from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic.dataclasses import dataclass # (2) @dataclass class Item : name : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None @dataclass class Author : name : str items : List [ Item ] = field ( default_factory = list ) # (3) app = FastAPI () @app . post ( \"/authors/ {author_id} /items/\" , response_model = Author ) # (4) async def create_author_items ( author_id : str , items : List [ Item ]): # (5) return { \"name\" : author_id , \"items\" : items } # (6) @app . get ( \"/authors/\" , response_model = List [ Author ]) # (7) def get_authors (): # (8) return [ # (9) { \"name\" : \"Breaters\" , \"items\" : [ { \"name\" : \"Island In The Moon\" , \"description\" : \"A place to be be playin' and havin' fun\" , }, { \"name\" : \"Holy Buddies\" }, ], }, { \"name\" : \"System of an Up\" , \"items\" : [ { \"name\" : \"Salt\" , \"description\" : \"The kombucha mushroom people's favorite\" , }, { \"name\" : \"Pad Thai\" }, { \"name\" : \"Lonely Night\" , \"description\" : \"The mostests lonliest nightiest of allest\" , }, ], }, ] We still import field from standard dataclasses . pydantic.dataclasses is a drop-in replacement for dataclasses . The Author dataclass includes a list of Item dataclasses. The Author dataclass is used as the response_model parameter. You can use other standard type annotations with dataclasses as the request body. In this case, it's a list of Item dataclasses. Here we are returning a dictionary that contains items which is a list of dataclasses. FastAPI is still capable of serializing the data to JSON. Here the response_model is using a type annotation of a list of Author dataclasses. Again, you can combine dataclasses with standard type annotations. Notice that this path operation function uses regular def instead of async def . As always, in FastAPI you can combine def and async def as needed. If you need a refresher about when to use which, check out the section \"In a hurry?\" in the docs about async and await . This path operation function is not returning dataclasses (although it could), but a list of dictionaries with internal data.

The Author dataclass includes a list of Item dataclasses. The Author dataclass is used as the response_model parameter. You can use other standard type annotations with dataclasses as the request body. In this case, it's a list of Item dataclasses. Here we are returning a dictionary that contains items which is a list of dataclasses. FastAPI is still capable of serializing the data to JSON. Here the response_model is using a type annotation of a list of Author dataclasses. Again, you can combine dataclasses with standard type annotations. Notice that this path operation function uses regular def instead of async def . As always, in FastAPI you can combine def and async def as needed. If you need a refresher about when to use which, check out the section \"In a hurry?\" in the docs about async and await . This path operation function is not returning dataclasses (although it could), but a list of dictionaries with internal data. FastAPI will use the response_model parameter (that includes dataclasses) to convert the response.

But you can help translating it: Contributing . Warning This is a rather advanced feature. You probably can skip it. If you are just following the tutorial - user guide, you can probably skip this section. If you already know that you need to modify the generated OpenAPI schema, continue reading. There are some cases where you might need to modify the generated OpenAPI schema. In this section you will see how. The normal process \u00b6 The normal (default) process, is as follows. A FastAPI application (instance) has an .openapi() method that is expected to return the OpenAPI schema. As part of the application object creation, a path operation for /openapi.json (or for whatever you set your openapi_url ) is registered. It just returns a JSON response with the result of the application's .openapi() method. By default, what the method .openapi() does is check the property .openapi_schema to see if it has contents and return them. If it doesn't, it generates them using the utility function at fastapi.openapi.utils.get_openapi . And that function get_openapi() receives as parameters: title : The OpenAPI title, shown in the docs. version : The version of your API, e.g. 2.5.0 . openapi_version : The version of the OpenAPI specification used. By default, the latest: 3.0.2 . description : The description of your API. routes : A list of routes, these are each of the registered path operations . They are taken from app.routes . Overriding the defaults \u00b6 Using the information above, you can use the same utility function to generate the OpenAPI schema and override each part that you need. For example, let's add ReDoc's OpenAPI extension to include a custom logo . Normal FastAPI \u00b6 First, write all your FastAPI application as normally: from fastapi import FastAPI from fastapi.openapi.utils import get_openapi app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items (): return [{ \"name\" : \"Foo\" }] def custom_openapi (): if app . openapi_schema : return app . openapi_schema openapi_schema = get_openapi ( title = \"Custom title\" , version = \"2.5.0\" , description = \"This is a very custom OpenAPI schema\" , routes = app . routes , ) openapi_schema [ \"info\" ][ \"x-logo\" ] = { \"url\" : \"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/logo-margin/logo-teal.png\" } app . openapi_schema = openapi_schema return app . openapi_schema app . openapi = custom_openapi Generate the OpenAPI schema \u00b6 Then, use the same utility function to generate the OpenAPI schema, inside a custom_openapi() function: from fastapi import FastAPI from fastapi.openapi.utils import get_openapi app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items (): return [{ \"name\" : \"Foo\" }] def custom_openapi (): if app . openapi_schema : return app . openapi_schema openapi_schema = get_openapi ( title = \"Custom title\" , version = \"2.5.0\" , description = \"This is a very custom OpenAPI schema\" , routes = app . routes , ) openapi_schema [ \"info\" ][ \"x-logo\" ] = { \"url\" : \"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/logo-margin/logo-teal.png\" } app . openapi_schema = openapi_schema return app . openapi_schema app . openapi = custom_openapi Modify the OpenAPI schema \u00b6 Now you can add the ReDoc extension, adding a custom x-logo to the info \"object\" in the OpenAPI schema: from fastapi import FastAPI from fastapi.openapi.utils import get_openapi app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items (): return [{ \"name\" : \"Foo\" }] def custom_openapi (): if app . openapi_schema : return app . openapi_schema openapi_schema = get_openapi ( title = \"Custom title\" , version = \"2.5.0\" , description = \"This is a very custom OpenAPI schema\" , routes = app . routes , ) openapi_schema [ \"info\" ][ \"x-logo\" ] = { \"url\" : \"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/logo-margin/logo-teal.png\" } app . openapi_schema = openapi_schema return app . openapi_schema app . openapi = custom_openapi Cache the OpenAPI schema \u00b6 You can use the property .openapi_schema as a \"cache\", to store your generated schema. That way, your application won't have to generate the schema every time a user opens your API docs. It will be generated only once, and then the same cached schema will be used for the next requests. from fastapi import FastAPI from fastapi.openapi.utils import get_openapi app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items (): return [{ \"name\" : \"Foo\" }] def custom_openapi (): if app . openapi_schema : return app . openapi_schema openapi_schema = get_openapi ( title = \"Custom title\" , version = \"2.5.0\" , description = \"This is a very custom OpenAPI schema\" , routes = app . routes , ) openapi_schema [ \"info\" ][ \"x-logo\" ] = { \"url\" : \"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/logo-margin/logo-teal.png\" } app . openapi_schema = openapi_schema return app . openapi_schema app . openapi = custom_openapi Override the method \u00b6 Now you can replace the .openapi() method with your new function. from fastapi import FastAPI from fastapi.openapi.utils import get_openapi app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items (): return [{ \"name\" : \"Foo\" }] def custom_openapi (): if app . openapi_schema : return app . openapi_schema openapi_schema = get_openapi ( title = \"Custom title\" , version = \"2.5.0\" , description = \"This is a very custom OpenAPI schema\" , routes = app . routes , ) openapi_schema [ \"info\" ][ \"x-logo\" ] = { \"url\" : \"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/logo-margin/logo-teal.png\" } app . openapi_schema = openapi_schema return app . openapi_schema app . openapi = custom_openapi Check it \u00b6 Once you go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc you will see that you are using your custom logo (in this example, FastAPI 's logo): Self-hosting JavaScript and CSS for docs \u00b6 The API docs use Swagger UI and ReDoc , and each of those need some JavaScript and CSS files. By default, those files are served from a CDN . But it's possible to customize it, you can set a specific CDN, or serve the files yourself. That's useful, for example, if you need your app to keep working even while offline, without open Internet access, or in a local network. Here you'll see how to serve those files yourself, in the same FastAPI app, and configure the docs to use them. Project file structure \u00b6 Let's say your project file structure looks like this: . \u251c\u2500\u2500 app \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 main.py Now create a directory to store those static files. Your new file structure could look like this: . \u251c\u2500\u2500 app \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 main.py \u2514\u2500\u2500 static/ Download the files \u00b6 Download the static files needed for the docs and put them on that static/ directory. You can probably right-click each link and select an option similar to Save link as... . Swagger UI uses the files: swagger-ui-bundle.js swagger-ui.css And ReDoc uses the file: redoc.standalone.js After that, your file structure could look like: . \u251c\u2500\u2500 app \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 main.py \u2514\u2500\u2500 static \u251c\u2500\u2500 redoc.standalone.js \u251c\u2500\u2500 swagger-ui-bundle.js \u2514\u2500\u2500 swagger-ui.css Serve the static files \u00b6 Import StaticFiles . \"Mount\" a StaticFiles() instance in a specific path. from fastapi import FastAPI from fastapi.openapi.docs import ( get_redoc_html , get_swagger_ui_html , get_swagger_ui_oauth2_redirect_html , ) from fastapi.staticfiles import StaticFiles app = FastAPI ( docs_url = None , redoc_url = None ) app . mount ( \"/static\" , StaticFiles ( directory = \"static\" ), name = \"static\" ) @app . get ( \"/docs\" , include_in_schema = False ) async def custom_swagger_ui_html (): return get_swagger_ui_html ( openapi_url = app . openapi_url , title = app . title + \" - Swagger UI\" , oauth2_redirect_url = app . swagger_ui_oauth2_redirect_url , swagger_js_url = \"/static/swagger-ui-bundle.js\" , swagger_css_url = \"/static/swagger-ui.css\" , ) @app . get ( app . swagger_ui_oauth2_redirect_url , include_in_schema = False ) async def swagger_ui_redirect (): return get_swagger_ui_oauth2_redirect_html () @app . get ( \"/redoc\" , include_in_schema = False ) async def redoc_html (): return get_redoc_html ( openapi_url = app . openapi_url , title = app . title + \" - ReDoc\" , redoc_js_url = \"/static/redoc.standalone.js\" , ) @app . get ( \"/users/ {username} \" ) async def read_user ( username : str ): return { \"message\" : f \"Hello { username } \" } Test the static files \u00b6 Start your application and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/redoc.standalone.js . You should see a very long JavaScript file for ReDoc . It could start with something like: /*! * ReDoc - OpenAPI/Swagger-generated API Reference Documentation * ------------------------------------------------------------- * Version: \"2.0.0-rc.18\" * Repo: https://github.com/Redocly/redoc */ ! function ( e , t ){ \"object\" == typeof exports && \"object\" == typeof m ... That confirms that you are being able to serve static files from your app, and that you placed the static files for the docs in the correct place. Now we can configure the app to use those static files for the docs. Disable the automatic docs \u00b6 The first step is to disable the automatic docs, as those use the CDN by default. To disable them, set their URLs to None when creating your FastAPI app: from fastapi import FastAPI from fastapi.openapi.docs import ( get_redoc_html , get_swagger_ui_html , get_swagger_ui_oauth2_redirect_html , ) from fastapi.staticfiles import StaticFiles app = FastAPI ( docs_url = None , redoc_url = None ) app . mount ( \"/static\" , StaticFiles ( directory = \"static\" ), name = \"static\" ) @app . get ( \"/docs\" , include_in_schema = False ) async def custom_swagger_ui_html (): return get_swagger_ui_html ( openapi_url = app . openapi_url , title = app . title + \" - Swagger UI\" , oauth2_redirect_url = app . swagger_ui_oauth2_redirect_url , swagger_js_url = \"/static/swagger-ui-bundle.js\" , swagger_css_url = \"/static/swagger-ui.css\" , ) @app . get ( app . swagger_ui_oauth2_redirect_url , include_in_schema = False ) async def swagger_ui_redirect (): return get_swagger_ui_oauth2_redirect_html () @app . get ( \"/redoc\" , include_in_schema = False ) async def redoc_html (): return get_redoc_html ( openapi_url = app . openapi_url , title = app . title + \" - ReDoc\" , redoc_js_url = \"/static/redoc.standalone.js\" , ) @app . get ( \"/users/ {username} \" ) async def read_user ( username : str ): return { \"message\" : f \"Hello { username } \" } Include the custom docs \u00b6 Now you can create the path operations for the custom docs. You can re-use FastAPI's internal functions to create the HTML pages for the docs, and pass them the needed arguments: openapi_url : the URL where the HTML page for the docs can get the OpenAPI schema for your API. You can use here the attribute app.openapi_url . title : the title of your API. oauth2_redirect_url : you can use app.swagger_ui_oauth2_redirect_url here to use the default. swagger_js_url : the URL where the HTML for your Swagger UI docs can get the JavaScript file. This is the one that your own app is now serving. swagger_css_url : the URL where the HTML for your Swagger UI docs can get the CSS file. This is the one that your own app is now serving. And similarly for ReDoc... from fastapi import FastAPI from fastapi.openapi.docs import ( get_redoc_html , get_swagger_ui_html , get_swagger_ui_oauth2_redirect_html , ) from fastapi.staticfiles import StaticFiles app = FastAPI ( docs_url = None , redoc_url = None ) app . mount ( \"/static\" , StaticFiles ( directory = \"static\" ), name = \"static\" ) @app . get ( \"/docs\" , include_in_schema = False ) async def custom_swagger_ui_html (): return get_swagger_ui_html ( openapi_url = app . openapi_url , title = app . title + \" - Swagger UI\" , oauth2_redirect_url = app . swagger_ui_oauth2_redirect_url , swagger_js_url = \"/static/swagger-ui-bundle.js\" , swagger_css_url = \"/static/swagger-ui.css\" , ) @app . get ( app . swagger_ui_oauth2_redirect_url , include_in_schema = False ) async def swagger_ui_redirect (): return get_swagger_ui_oauth2_redirect_html () @app . get ( \"/redoc\" , include_in_schema = False ) async def redoc_html (): return get_redoc_html ( openapi_url = app . openapi_url , title = app . title + \" - ReDoc\" , redoc_js_url = \"/static/redoc.standalone.js\" , ) @app . get ( \"/users/ {username} \" ) async def read_user ( username : str ): return { \"message\" : f \"Hello { username } \" } Tip The path operation for swagger_ui_redirect is a helper for when you use OAuth2. If you integrate your API with an OAuth2 provider, you will be able to authenticate and come back to the API docs with the acquired credentials. And interact with it using the real OAuth2 authentication. Swagger UI will handle it behind the scenes for you, but it needs this \"redirect\" helper. Create a path operation to test it \u00b6 Now, to be able to test that everything works, create a path operation : from fastapi import FastAPI from fastapi.openapi.docs import ( get_redoc_html , get_swagger_ui_html , get_swagger_ui_oauth2_redirect_html , ) from fastapi.staticfiles import StaticFiles app = FastAPI ( docs_url = None , redoc_url = None ) app . mount ( \"/static\" , StaticFiles ( directory = \"static\" ), name = \"static\" ) @app . get ( \"/docs\" , include_in_schema = False ) async def custom_swagger_ui_html (): return get_swagger_ui_html ( openapi_url = app . openapi_url , title = app . title + \" - Swagger UI\" , oauth2_redirect_url = app . swagger_ui_oauth2_redirect_url , swagger_js_url = \"/static/swagger-ui-bundle.js\" , swagger_css_url = \"/static/swagger-ui.css\" , ) @app . get ( app . swagger_ui_oauth2_redirect_url , include_in_schema = False ) async def swagger_ui_redirect (): return get_swagger_ui_oauth2_redirect_html () @app . get ( \"/redoc\" , include_in_schema = False ) async def redoc_html (): return get_redoc_html ( openapi_url = app . openapi_url , title = app . title + \" - ReDoc\" , redoc_js_url = \"/static/redoc.standalone.js\" , ) @app . get ( \"/users/ {username} \" ) async def read_user ( username : str ): return { \"message\" : f \"Hello { username } \" } Test it \u00b6 Now, you should be able to disconnect your WiFi, go to your docs at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs , and reload the page. And even without Internet, you would be able to see the docs for your API and interact with it. Configuring Swagger UI \u00b6 You can configure some extra Swagger UI parameters . To configure them, pass the swagger_ui_parameters argument when creating the FastAPI() app object or to the get_swagger_ui_html() function. swagger_ui_parameters receives a dictionary with the configurations passed to Swagger UI directly. FastAPI converts the configurations to JSON to make them compatible with JavaScript, as that's what Swagger UI needs. Disable Syntax Highlighting \u00b6 For example, you could disable syntax highlighting in Swagger UI. Without changing the settings, syntax highlighting is enabled by default: But you can disable it by setting syntaxHighlight to False : from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI ( swagger_ui_parameters = { \"syntaxHighlight\" : False }) @app . get ( \"/users/ {username} \" ) async def read_user ( username : str ): return { \"message\" : f \"Hello { username } \" } ...and then Swagger UI won't show the syntax highlighting anymore: Change the Theme \u00b6 The same way you could set the syntax highlighting theme with the key \"syntaxHighlight.theme\" (notice that it has a dot in the middle): from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI ( swagger_ui_parameters = { \"syntaxHighlight.theme\" : \"obsidian\" }) @app . get ( \"/users/ {username} \" ) async def read_user ( username : str ): return { \"message\" : f \"Hello { username } \" } That configuration would change the syntax highlighting color theme: Change Default Swagger UI Parameters \u00b6 FastAPI includes some default configuration parameters appropriate for most of the use cases. It includes these default configurations: swagger_ui_default_parameters = { \"dom_id\" : \"#swagger-ui\" , \"layout\" : \"BaseLayout\" , \"deepLinking\" : True , \"showExtensions\" : True , \"showCommonExtensions\" : True , } You can override any of them by setting a different value in the argument swagger_ui_parameters . For example, to disable deepLinking you could pass these settings to swagger_ui_parameters : from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI ( swagger_ui_parameters = { \"deepLinking\" : False }) @app . get ( \"/users/ {username} \" ) async def read_user ( username : str ): return { \"message\" : f \"Hello { username } \" } Other Swagger UI Parameters \u00b6 To see all the other possible configurations you can use, read the official docs for Swagger UI parameters . JavaScript-only settings \u00b6 Swagger UI also allows other configurations to be JavaScript-only objects (for example, JavaScript functions). FastAPI also includes these JavaScript-only presets settings: presets : [ SwaggerUIBundle . presets . apis , SwaggerUIBundle . SwaggerUIStandalonePreset ] These are JavaScript objects, not strings, so you can't pass them from Python code directly. If you need to use JavaScript-only configurations like those, you can use one of the methods above. Override all the Swagger UI path operation and manually write any JavaScript you need.","title":"Extending OpenAPI"},{"location":"advanced/extending-openapi/#extending-openapi","text":"Warning The current page still doesn't have a translation for this language.

But you can help translating it: Contributing . As FastAPI is based on the OpenAPI specification, you get automatic compatibility with many tools, including the automatic API docs (provided by Swagger UI). One particular advantage that is not necessarily obvious is that you can generate clients (sometimes called SDKs ) for your API, for many different programming languages . OpenAPI Client Generators \u00b6 There are many tools to generate clients from OpenAPI . A common tool is OpenAPI Generator . If you are building a frontend , a very interesting alternative is openapi-typescript-codegen . Generate a TypeScript Frontend Client \u00b6 Let's start with a simple FastAPI application: Python 3.6 and above Python 3.9 and above from typing import List from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str price : float class ResponseMessage ( BaseModel ): message : str @app . post ( \"/items/\" , response_model = ResponseMessage ) async def create_item ( item : Item ): return { \"message\" : \"item received\" } @app . get ( \"/items/\" , response_model = List [ Item ]) async def get_items (): return [ { \"name\" : \"Plumbus\" , \"price\" : 3 }, { \"name\" : \"Portal Gun\" , \"price\" : 9001 }, ] from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str price : float class ResponseMessage ( BaseModel ): message : str @app . post ( \"/items/\" , response_model = ResponseMessage ) async def create_item ( item : Item ): return { \"message\" : \"item received\" } @app . get ( \"/items/\" , response_model = list [ Item ]) async def get_items (): return [ { \"name\" : \"Plumbus\" , \"price\" : 3 }, { \"name\" : \"Portal Gun\" , \"price\" : 9001 }, ] Notice that the path operations define the models they use for request payload and response payload, using the models Item and ResponseMessage . API Docs \u00b6 If you go to the API docs, you will see that it has the schemas for the data to be sent in requests and received in responses: You can see those schemas because they were declared with the models in the app. That information is available in the app's OpenAPI schema , and then shown in the API docs (by Swagger UI). And that same information from the models that is included in OpenAPI is what can be used to generate the client code . Generate a TypeScript Client \u00b6 Now that we have the app with the models, we can generate the client code for the frontend. Install openapi-typescript-codegen \u00b6 You can install openapi-typescript-codegen in your frontend code with: $ npm install openapi-typescript-codegen --save-dev ---> 100% Generate Client Code \u00b6 To generate the client code you can use the command line application openapi that would now be installed. Because it is installed in the local project, you probably wouldn't be able to call that command directly, but you would put it on your package.json file. It could look like this: { \"name\" : \"frontend-app\" , \"version\" : \"1.0.0\" , \"description\" : \"\" , \"main\" : \"index.js\" , \"scripts\" : { \"generate-client\" : \"openapi --input http://localhost:8000/openapi.json --output ./src/client --client axios\" }, \"author\" : \"\" , \"license\" : \"\" , \"devDependencies\" : { \"openapi-typescript-codegen\" : \"^0.20.1\" , \"typescript\" : \"^4.6.2\" } } After having that NPM generate-client script there, you can run it with: $ npm run generate-client frontend-app@1.0.0 generate-client /home/user/code/frontend-app > openapi --input http://localhost:8000/openapi.json --output ./src/client --client axios That command will generate code in ./src/client and will use axios (the frontend HTTP library) internally. Try Out the Client Code \u00b6 Now you can import and use the client code, it could look like this, notice that you get autocompletion for the methods: You will also get autocompletion for the payload to send: Tip Notice the autocompletion for name and price , that was defined in the FastAPI application, in the Item model. You will have inline errors for the data that you send: The response object will also have autocompletion: FastAPI App with Tags \u00b6 In many cases your FastAPI app will be bigger, and you will probably use tags to separate different groups of path operations . For example, you could have a section for items and another section for users , and they could be separated by tags: Python 3.6 and above Python 3.9 and above from typing import List from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str price : float class ResponseMessage ( BaseModel ): message : str class User ( BaseModel ): username : str email : str @app . post ( \"/items/\" , response_model = ResponseMessage , tags = [ \"items\" ]) async def create_item ( item : Item ): return { \"message\" : \"Item received\" } @app . get ( \"/items/\" , response_model = List [ Item ], tags = [ \"items\" ]) async def get_items (): return [ { \"name\" : \"Plumbus\" , \"price\" : 3 }, { \"name\" : \"Portal Gun\" , \"price\" : 9001 }, ] @app . post ( \"/users/\" , response_model = ResponseMessage , tags = [ \"users\" ]) async def create_user ( user : User ): return { \"message\" : \"User received\" } from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str price : float class ResponseMessage ( BaseModel ): message : str class User ( BaseModel ): username : str email : str @app . post ( \"/items/\" , response_model = ResponseMessage , tags = [ \"items\" ]) async def create_item ( item : Item ): return { \"message\" : \"Item received\" } @app . get ( \"/items/\" , response_model = list [ Item ], tags = [ \"items\" ]) async def get_items (): return [ { \"name\" : \"Plumbus\" , \"price\" : 3 }, { \"name\" : \"Portal Gun\" , \"price\" : 9001 }, ] @app . post ( \"/users/\" , response_model = ResponseMessage , tags = [ \"users\" ]) async def create_user ( user : User ): return { \"message\" : \"User received\" } Generate a TypeScript Client with Tags \u00b6 If you generate a client for a FastAPI app using tags, it will normally also separate the client code based on the tags. This way you will be able to have things ordered and grouped correctly for the client code: In this case you have: ItemsService UsersService Client Method Names \u00b6 Right now the generated method names like createItemItemsPost don't look very clean: ItemsService . createItemItemsPost ({ name : \"Plumbus\" , price : 5 }) ...that's because the client generator uses the OpenAPI internal operation ID for each path operation . OpenAPI requires that each operation ID is unique across all the path operations , so FastAPI uses the function name , the path , and the HTTP method/operation to generate that operation ID, because that way it can make sure that the operation IDs are unique. But I'll show you how to improve that next. \ud83e\udd13 Custom Operation IDs and Better Method Names \u00b6 You can modify the way these operation IDs are generated to make them simpler and have simpler method names in the clients. In this case you will have to ensure that each operation ID is unique in some other way. For example, you could make sure that each path operation has a tag, and then generate the operation ID based on the tag and the path operation name (the function name). Custom Generate Unique ID Function \u00b6 FastAPI uses a unique ID for each path operation , it is used for the operation ID and also for the names of any needed custom models, for requests or responses. You can customize that function. It takes an APIRoute and outputs a string. For example, here it is using the first tag (you will probably have only one tag) and the path operation name (the function name). You can then pass that custom function to FastAPI as the generate_unique_id_function parameter: Python 3.6 and above Python 3.9 and above from typing import List from fastapi import FastAPI from fastapi.routing import APIRoute from pydantic import BaseModel def custom_generate_unique_id ( route : APIRoute ): return f \" { route . tags [ 0 ] } - { route . name } \" app = FastAPI ( generate_unique_id_function = custom_generate_unique_id ) class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str price : float class ResponseMessage ( BaseModel ): message : str class User ( BaseModel ): username : str email : str @app . post ( \"/items/\" , response_model = ResponseMessage , tags = [ \"items\" ]) async def create_item ( item : Item ): return { \"message\" : \"Item received\" } @app . get ( \"/items/\" , response_model = List [ Item ], tags = [ \"items\" ]) async def get_items (): return [ { \"name\" : \"Plumbus\" , \"price\" : 3 }, { \"name\" : \"Portal Gun\" , \"price\" : 9001 }, ] @app . post ( \"/users/\" , response_model = ResponseMessage , tags = [ \"users\" ]) async def create_user ( user : User ): return { \"message\" : \"User received\" } from fastapi import FastAPI from fastapi.routing import APIRoute from pydantic import BaseModel def custom_generate_unique_id ( route : APIRoute ): return f \" { route . tags [ 0 ] } - { route . name } \" app = FastAPI ( generate_unique_id_function = custom_generate_unique_id ) class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str price : float class ResponseMessage ( BaseModel ): message : str class User ( BaseModel ): username : str email : str @app . post ( \"/items/\" , response_model = ResponseMessage , tags = [ \"items\" ]) async def create_item ( item : Item ): return { \"message\" : \"Item received\" } @app . get ( \"/items/\" , response_model = list [ Item ], tags = [ \"items\" ]) async def get_items (): return [ { \"name\" : \"Plumbus\" , \"price\" : 3 }, { \"name\" : \"Portal Gun\" , \"price\" : 9001 }, ] @app . post ( \"/users/\" , response_model = ResponseMessage , tags = [ \"users\" ]) async def create_user ( user : User ): return { \"message\" : \"User received\" } Generate a TypeScript Client with Custom Operation IDs \u00b6 Now if you generate the client again, you will see that it has the improved method names: As you see, the method names now have the tag and then the function name, now they don't include information from the URL path and the HTTP operation. Preprocess the OpenAPI Specification for the Client Generator \u00b6 The generated code still has some duplicated information . We already know that this method is related to the items because that word is in the ItemsService (taken from the tag), but we still have the tag name prefixed in the method name too. \ud83d\ude15 We will probably still want to keep it for OpenAPI in general, as that will ensure that the operation IDs are unique . But for the generated client we could modify the OpenAPI operation IDs right before generating the clients, just to make those method names nicer and cleaner .

Generate a TypeScript Client with the Preprocessed OpenAPI \u00b6 Now as the end result is in a file openapi.json , you would modify the package.json to use that local file, for example: { \"name\" : \"frontend-app\" , \"version\" : \"1.0.0\" , \"description\" : \"\" , \"main\" : \"index.js\" , \"scripts\" : { \"generate-client\" : \"openapi --input ./openapi.json --output ./src/client --client axios\" }, \"author\" : \"\" , \"license\" : \"\" , \"devDependencies\" : { \"openapi-typescript-codegen\" : \"^0.20.1\" , \"typescript\" : \"^4.6.2\" } } After generating the new client, you would now have clean method names , with all the autocompletion , inline errors , etc: Benefits \u00b6 When using the automatically generated clients you would autocompletion for: Methods. Request payloads in the body, query parameters, etc. Response payloads. You would also have inline errors for everything. And whenever you update the backend code, and regenerate the frontend, it would have any new path operations available as methods, the old ones removed, and any other change would be reflected on the generated code. \ud83e\udd13 This also means that if something changed it will be reflected on the client code automatically.

They are generally all related to the same application. The analogy in the relational database world would be a \"database\" (a specific database, not the database server). The analogy in MongoDB would be a \"collection\". In the code, a Bucket represents the main entrypoint of communication with the database. This utility function will: Connect to a Couchbase cluster (that might be a single machine). Set defaults for timeouts. Authenticate in the cluster. Get a Bucket instance. Set defaults for timeouts.

User model \u00b6 First, let's create a User model: from typing import Union from couchbase.options import LockMode from couchbase.bucket import Bucket from couchbase.cluster import Cluster , ClusterOptions from couchbase.auth import PasswordAuthenticator from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel USERPROFILE_DOC_TYPE = \"userprofile\" def get_bucket (): cluster = Cluster ( \"couchbase://couchbasehost:8091?fetch_mutation_tokens=1&operation_timeout=30&n1ql_timeout=300\" , ClusterOptions ( PasswordAuthenticator ( \"username\" , \"password\" )) ) bucket : Bucket = cluster . open_bucket ( \"bucket_name\" , lockmode = LockMode .

UserInDB model \u00b6 Now, let's create a UserInDB model. This will have the data that is actually stored in the database. We don't create it as a subclass of Pydantic's BaseModel but as a subclass of our own User , because it will have all the attributes in User plus a couple more: from typing import Union from couchbase.options import LockMode from couchbase.bucket import Bucket from couchbase.cluster import Cluster , ClusterOptions from couchbase.auth import PasswordAuthenticator from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel USERPROFILE_DOC_TYPE = \"userprofile\" def get_bucket (): cluster = Cluster ( \"couchbase://couchbasehost:8091?fetch_mutation_tokens=1&operation_timeout=30&n1ql_timeout=300\" , ClusterOptions ( PasswordAuthenticator ( \"username\" , \"password\" )) ) bucket : Bucket = cluster . open_bucket ( \"bucket_name\" , lockmode = LockMode .

But it is not part of the general User model (the one we will return in the path operation ). Get the user \u00b6 Now create a function that will: Take a username. Generate a document ID from it. Get the document with that ID. Put the contents of the document in a UserInDB model. By creating a function that is only dedicated to getting your user from a username (or any other parameter) independent of your path operation function , you can more easily re-use it in multiple parts and also add unit tests for it: from typing import Union from couchbase.options import LockMode from couchbase.bucket import Bucket from couchbase.cluster import Cluster , ClusterOptions from couchbase.auth import PasswordAuthenticator from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel USERPROFILE_DOC_TYPE = \"userprofile\" def get_bucket (): cluster = Cluster ( \"couchbase://couchbasehost:8091?fetch_mutation_tokens=1&operation_timeout=30&n1ql_timeout=300\" , ClusterOptions ( PasswordAuthenticator ( \"username\" , \"password\" )) ) bucket : Bucket = cluster . open_bucket ( \"bucket_name\" , lockmode = LockMode .

Any variable that is put inside of {} in an f-string will be expanded / injected in the string. dict unpacking \u00b6 If you are not familiar with the UserInDB(**result.value) , it is using dict \"unpacking\" . It will take the dict at result.value , and take each of its keys and values and pass them as key-values to UserInDB as keyword arguments. So, if the dict contains: { \"username\" : \"johndoe\" , \"hashed_password\" : \"some_hash\" , } It will be passed to UserInDB as: UserInDB ( username = \"johndoe\" , hashed_password = \"some_hash\" ) Create your FastAPI code \u00b6 Create the FastAPI app \u00b6 from typing import Union from couchbase.options import LockMode from couchbase.bucket import Bucket from couchbase.cluster import Cluster , ClusterOptions from couchbase.auth import PasswordAuthenticator from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel USERPROFILE_DOC_TYPE = \"userprofile\" def get_bucket (): cluster = Cluster ( \"couchbase://couchbasehost:8091?fetch_mutation_tokens=1&operation_timeout=30&n1ql_timeout=300\" , ClusterOptions ( PasswordAuthenticator ( \"username\" , \"password\" )) ) bucket : Bucket = cluster . open_bucket ( \"bucket_name\" , lockmode = LockMode .

But you can help translating it: Contributing . You could create an API with a path operation that could trigger a request to an external API created by someone else (probably the same developer that would be using your API). The process that happens when your API app calls the external API is named a \"callback\". Because the software that the external developer wrote sends a request to your API and then your API calls back , sending a request to an external API (that was probably created by the same developer). In this case, you could want to document how that external API should look like. What path operation it should have, what body it should expect, what response it should return, etc. An app with callbacks \u00b6 Let's see all this with an example. Imagine you develop an app that allows creating invoices. These invoices will have an id , title (optional), customer , and total . The user of your API (an external developer) will create an invoice in your API with a POST request. Then your API will (let's imagine): Send the invoice to some customer of the external developer.

This will be done by sending a POST request (from your API ) to some external API provided by that external developer (this is the \"callback\").

It will have a path operation that will receive an Invoice body, and a query parameter callback_url that will contain the URL for the callback. This part is pretty normal, most of the code is probably already familiar to you: from typing import Union from fastapi import APIRouter , FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel , HttpUrl app = FastAPI () class Invoice ( BaseModel ): id : str title : Union [ str , None ] = None customer : str total : float class InvoiceEvent ( BaseModel ): description : str paid : bool class InvoiceEventReceived ( BaseModel ): ok : bool invoices_callback_router = APIRouter () @invoices_callback_router . post ( \"{$callback_url}/invoices/{$request.body.id}\" , response_model = InvoiceEventReceived ) def invoice_notification ( body : InvoiceEvent ): pass @app . post ( \"/invoices/\" , callbacks = invoices_callback_router . routes ) def create_invoice ( invoice : Invoice , callback_url : Union [ HttpUrl , None ] = None ): \"\"\" Create an invoice. This will (let's imagine) let the API user (some external developer) create an invoice. And this path operation will: * Send the invoice to the client. * Collect the money from the client. * Send a notification back to the API user (the external developer), as a callback. * At this point is that the API will somehow send a POST request to the external API with the notification of the invoice event (e.g. \"payment successful\"). \"\"\" # Send the invoice, collect the money, send the notification (the callback) return { \"msg\" : \"Invoice received\" } Tip The callback_url query parameter uses a Pydantic URL type. The only new thing is the callbacks=messages_callback_router.routes as an argument to the path operation decorator . We'll see what that is next. Documenting the callback \u00b6 The actual callback code will depend heavily on your own API app. And it will probably vary a lot from one app to the next. It could be just one or two lines of code, like: callback_url = \"https://example.com/api/v1/invoices/events/\" requests . post ( callback_url , json = { \"description\" : \"Invoice paid\" , \"paid\" : True }) But possibly the most important part of the callback is making sure that your API user (the external developer) implements the external API correctly, according to the data that your API is going to send in the request body of the callback, etc. So, what we will do next is add the code to document how that external API should look like to receive the callback from your API . That documentation will show up in the Swagger UI at /docs in your API, and it will let external developers know how to build the external API . This example doesn't implement the callback itself (that could be just a line of code), only the documentation part. Tip The actual callback is just an HTTP request. When implementing the callback yourself, you could use something like HTTPX or Requests . Write the callback documentation code \u00b6 This code won't be executed in your app, we only need it to document how that external API should look like. But, you already know how to easily create automatic documentation for an API with FastAPI . So we are going to use that same knowledge to document how the external API should look like... by creating the path operation(s) that the external API should implement (the ones your API will call). Tip When writing the code to document a callback, it might be useful to imagine that you are that external developer . And that you are currently implementing the external API , not your API . Temporarily adopting this point of view (of the external developer ) can help you feel like it's more obvious where to put the parameters, the Pydantic model for the body, for the response, etc. for that external API . Create a callback APIRouter \u00b6 First create a new APIRouter that will contain one or more callbacks. from typing import Union from fastapi import APIRouter , FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel , HttpUrl app = FastAPI () class Invoice ( BaseModel ): id : str title : Union [ str , None ] = None customer : str total : float class InvoiceEvent ( BaseModel ): description : str paid : bool class InvoiceEventReceived ( BaseModel ): ok : bool invoices_callback_router = APIRouter () @invoices_callback_router . post ( \"{$callback_url}/invoices/{$request.body.id}\" , response_model = InvoiceEventReceived ) def invoice_notification ( body : InvoiceEvent ): pass @app . post ( \"/invoices/\" , callbacks = invoices_callback_router . routes ) def create_invoice ( invoice : Invoice , callback_url : Union [ HttpUrl , None ] = None ): \"\"\" Create an invoice. This will (let's imagine) let the API user (some external developer) create an invoice. And this path operation will: * Send the invoice to the client. * Collect the money from the client. * Send a notification back to the API user (the external developer), as a callback. * At this point is that the API will somehow send a POST request to the external API with the notification of the invoice event (e.g. \"payment successful\"). \"\"\" # Send the invoice, collect the money, send the notification (the callback) return { \"msg\" : \"Invoice received\" } Create the callback path operation \u00b6 To create the callback path operation use the same APIRouter you created above. It should look just like a normal FastAPI path operation : It should probably have a declaration of the body it should receive, e.g. body: InvoiceEvent . And it could also have a declaration of the response it should return, e.g. response_model=InvoiceEventReceived . from typing import Union from fastapi import APIRouter , FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel , HttpUrl app = FastAPI () class Invoice ( BaseModel ): id : str title : Union [ str , None ] = None customer : str total : float class InvoiceEvent ( BaseModel ): description : str paid : bool class InvoiceEventReceived ( BaseModel ): ok : bool invoices_callback_router = APIRouter () @invoices_callback_router . post ( \"{$callback_url}/invoices/{$request.body.id}\" , response_model = InvoiceEventReceived ) def invoice_notification ( body : InvoiceEvent ): pass @app . post ( \"/invoices/\" , callbacks = invoices_callback_router . routes ) def create_invoice ( invoice : Invoice , callback_url : Union [ HttpUrl , None ] = None ): \"\"\" Create an invoice. This will (let's imagine) let the API user (some external developer) create an invoice. And this path operation will: * Send the invoice to the client. * Collect the money from the client. * Send a notification back to the API user (the external developer), as a callback. * At this point is that the API will somehow send a POST request to the external API with the notification of the invoice event (e.g. \"payment successful\"). \"\"\" # Send the invoice, collect the money, send the notification (the callback) return { \"msg\" : \"Invoice received\" } There are 2 main differences from a normal path operation : It doesn't need to have any actual code, because your app will never call this code. It's only used to document the external API . So, the function could just have pass . The path can contain an OpenAPI 3 expression (see more below) where it can use variables with parameters and parts of the original request sent to your API . The callback path expression \u00b6 The callback path can have an OpenAPI 3 expression that can contain parts of the original request sent to your API . In this case, it's the str : \"{$callback_url}/invoices/{$request.body.id}\" So, if your API user (the external developer) sends a request to your API to: https://yourapi.com/invoices/?callback_url=https://www.external.org/events with a JSON body of: { \"id\" : \"2expen51ve\" , \"customer\" : \"Mr. Richie Rich\" , \"total\" : \"9999\" } Then your API will process the invoice, and at some point later, send a callback request to the callback_url (the external API ): https://www.external.org/events/invoices/2expen51ve with a JSON body containing something like: { \"description\" : \"Payment celebration\" , \"paid\" : true } and it would expect a response from that external API with a JSON body like: { \"ok\" : true } Tip Notice how the callback URL used contains the URL received as a query parameter in callback_url ( https://www.external.org/events ) and also the invoice id from inside of the JSON body ( 2expen51ve ). Add the callback router \u00b6 At this point you have the callback path operation(s) needed (the one(s) that the external developer should implement in the external API ) in the callback router you created above. Now use the parameter callbacks in your API's path operation decorator to pass the attribute .routes (that's actually just a list of routes/ path operations ) from that callback router: from typing import Union from fastapi import APIRouter , FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel , HttpUrl app = FastAPI () class Invoice ( BaseModel ): id : str title : Union [ str , None ] = None customer : str total : float class InvoiceEvent ( BaseModel ): description : str paid : bool class InvoiceEventReceived ( BaseModel ): ok : bool invoices_callback_router = APIRouter () @invoices_callback_router . post ( \"{$callback_url}/invoices/{$request.body.id}\" , response_model = InvoiceEventReceived ) def invoice_notification ( body : InvoiceEvent ): pass @app . post ( \"/invoices/\" , callbacks = invoices_callback_router . routes ) def create_invoice ( invoice : Invoice , callback_url : Union [ HttpUrl , None ] = None ): \"\"\" Create an invoice.

Warning If you do this, you have to make sure each one of your path operation functions has a unique name. Even if they are in different modules (Python files). Exclude from OpenAPI \u00b6 To exclude a path operation from the generated OpenAPI schema (and thus, from the automatic documentation systems), use the parameter include_in_schema and set it to False : from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" , include_in_schema = False ) async def read_items (): return [{ \"item_id\" : \"Foo\" }] Advanced description from docstring \u00b6 You can limit the lines used from the docstring of a path operation function for OpenAPI. Adding an \\f (an escaped \"form feed\" character) causes FastAPI to truncate the output used for OpenAPI at this point. It won't show up in the documentation, but other tools (such as Sphinx) will be able to use the rest. from typing import Set , Union from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None price : float tax : Union [ float , None ] = None tags : Set [ str ] = set () @app . post ( \"/items/\" , response_model = Item , summary = \"Create an item\" ) async def create_item ( item : Item ): \"\"\" Create an item with all the information: - **name**: each item must have a name - **description**: a long description - **price**: required - **tax**: if the item doesn't have tax, you can omit this - **tags**: a set of unique tag strings for this item \\f :param item: User input. \"\"\" return item Additional Responses \u00b6 You probably have seen how to declare the response_model and status_code for a path operation . That defines the metadata about the main response of a path operation . You can also declare additional responses with their models, status codes, etc. There's a whole chapter here in the documentation about it, you can read it at Additional Responses in OpenAPI . OpenAPI Extra \u00b6 When you declare a path operation in your application, FastAPI automatically generates the relevant metadata about that path operation to be included in the OpenAPI schema. Technical details In the OpenAPI specification it is called the Operation Object . It has all the information about the path operation and is used to generate the automatic documentation. It includes the tags , parameters , requestBody , responses , etc. This path operation -specific OpenAPI schema is normally generated automatically by FastAPI , but you can also extend it. Tip This is a low level extension point. If you only need to declare additional responses, a more convenient way to do it is with Additional Responses in OpenAPI . You can extend the OpenAPI schema for a path operation using the parameter openapi_extra . OpenAPI Extensions \u00b6 This openapi_extra can be helpful, for example, to declare OpenAPI Extensions : from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" , openapi_extra = { \"x-aperture-labs-portal\" : \"blue\" }) async def read_items (): return [{ \"item_id\" : \"portal-gun\" }] If you open the automatic API docs, your extension will show up at the bottom of the specific path operation . And if you see the resulting OpenAPI (at /openapi.json in your API), you will see your extension as part of the specific path operation too: { \"openapi\" : \"3.0.2\" , \"info\" : { \"title\" : \"FastAPI\" , \"version\" : \"0.1.0\" }, \"paths\" : { \"/items/\" : { \"get\" : { \"summary\" : \"Read Items\" , \"operationId\" : \"read_items_items__get\" , \"responses\" : { \"200\" : { \"description\" : \"Successful Response\" , \"content\" : { \"application/json\" : { \"schema\" : {} } } } }, \"x-aperture-labs-portal\" : \"blue\" } } } } Custom OpenAPI path operation schema \u00b6 The dictionary in openapi_extra will be deeply merged with the automatically generated OpenAPI schema for the path operation . So, you could add additional data to the automatically generated schema. For example, you could decide to read and validate the request with your own code, without using the automatic features of FastAPI with Pydantic, but you could still want to define the request in the OpenAPI schema. You could do that with openapi_extra : from fastapi import FastAPI , Request app = FastAPI () def magic_data_reader ( raw_body : bytes ): return { \"size\" : len ( raw_body ), \"content\" : { \"name\" : \"Maaaagic\" , \"price\" : 42 , \"description\" : \"Just kiddin', no magic here. \u2728\" , }, } @app . post ( \"/items/\" , openapi_extra = { \"requestBody\" : { \"content\" : { \"application/json\" : { \"schema\" : { \"required\" : [ \"name\" , \"price\" ], \"type\" : \"object\" , \"properties\" : { \"name\" : { \"type\" : \"string\" }, \"price\" : { \"type\" : \"number\" }, \"description\" : { \"type\" : \"string\" }, }, } } }, \"required\" : True , }, }, ) async def create_item ( request : Request ): raw_body = await request . body () data = magic_data_reader ( raw_body ) return data In this example, we didn't declare any Pydantic model. In fact, the request body is not even parsed as JSON, it is read directly as bytes , and the function magic_data_reader() would be in charge of parsing it in some way. Nevertheless, we can declare the expected schema for the request body. Custom OpenAPI content type \u00b6 Using this same trick, you could use a Pydantic model to define the JSON Schema that is then included in the custom OpenAPI schema section for the path operation . And you could do this even if the data type in the request is not JSON. For example, in this application we don't use FastAPI's integrated functionality to extract the JSON Schema from Pydantic models nor the automatic validation for JSON. In fact, we are declaring the request content type as YAML, not JSON: from typing import List import yaml from fastapi import FastAPI , HTTPException , Request from pydantic import BaseModel , ValidationError app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str tags : List [ str ] @app . post ( \"/items/\" , openapi_extra = { \"requestBody\" : { \"content\" : { \"application/x-yaml\" : { \"schema\" : Item . schema ()}}, \"required\" : True , }, }, ) async def create_item ( request : Request ): raw_body = await request . body () try : data = yaml . safe_load ( raw_body ) except yaml . YAMLError : raise HTTPException ( status_code = 422 , detail = \"Invalid YAML\" ) try : item = Item . parse_obj ( data ) except ValidationError as e : raise HTTPException ( status_code = 422 , detail = e . errors ()) return item Nevertheless, although we are not using the default integrated functionality, we are still using a Pydantic model to manually generate the JSON Schema for the data that we want to receive in YAML. Then we use the request directly, and extract the body as bytes . This means that FastAPI won't even try to parse the request payload as JSON. And then in our code, we parse that YAML content directly, and then we are again using the same Pydantic model to validate the YAML content: from typing import List import yaml from fastapi import FastAPI , HTTPException , Request from pydantic import BaseModel , ValidationError app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str tags : List [ str ] @app . post ( \"/items/\" , openapi_extra = { \"requestBody\" : { \"content\" : { \"application/x-yaml\" : { \"schema\" : Item . schema ()}}, \"required\" : True , }, }, ) async def create_item ( request : Request ): raw_body = await request . body () try : data = yaml . safe_load ( raw_body ) except yaml . YAMLError : raise HTTPException ( status_code = 422 , detail = \"Invalid YAML\" ) try : item = Item . parse_obj ( data ) except ValidationError as e : raise HTTPException ( status_code = 422 , detail = e . errors ()) return item Tip Here we re-use the same Pydantic model.

You can create and use environment variables in the shell, without needing Python: Linux, macOS, Windows Bash Windows PowerShell // You could create an env var MY_NAME with $ export MY_NAME = \"Wade Wilson\" // Then you could use it with other programs, like $ echo \"Hello $MY_NAME \" Hello Wade Wilson // Create an env var MY_NAME $ $Env :MY_NAME = \"Wade Wilson\" // Use it with other programs, like $ echo \"Hello $Env :MY_NAME\" Hello Wade Wilson Read env vars in Python \u00b6 You could also create environment variables outside of Python, in the terminal (or with any other method), and then read them in Python. For example you could have a file main.py with: import os name = os . getenv ( \"MY_NAME\" , \"World\" ) print ( f \"Hello { name } from Python\" ) Tip The second argument to os.getenv() is the default value to return. If not provided, it's None by default, here we provide \"World\" as the default value to use. Then you could call that Python program: // Here we don't set the env var yet $ python main.py // As we didn't set the env var, we get the default value Hello World from Python // But if we create an environment variable first $ export MY_NAME = \"Wade Wilson\" // And then call the program again $ python main.py // Now it can read the environment variable Hello Wade Wilson from Python As environment variables can be set outside of the code, but can be read by the code, and don't have to be stored (committed to git ) with the rest of the files, it's common to use them for configurations or settings. You can also create an environment variable only for a specific program invocation, that is only available to that program, and only for its duration. To do that, create it right before the program itself, on the same line: // Create an env var MY_NAME in line for this program call $ MY_NAME = \"Wade Wilson\" python main.py // Now it can read the environment variable Hello Wade Wilson from Python // The env var no longer exists afterwards $ python main.py Hello World from Python Tip You can read more about it at The Twelve-Factor App: Config . Types and validation \u00b6 These environment variables can only handle text strings, as they are external to Python and have to be compatible with other programs and the rest of the system (and even with different operating systems, as Linux, Windows, macOS). That means that any value read in Python from an environment variable will be a str , and any conversion to a different type or validation has to be done in code. Pydantic Settings \u00b6 Fortunately, Pydantic provides a great utility to handle these settings coming from environment variables with Pydantic: Settings management . Create the Settings object \u00b6 Import BaseSettings from Pydantic and create a sub-class, very much like with a Pydantic model. The same way as with Pydantic models, you declare class attributes with type annotations, and possibly default values. You can use all the same validation features and tools you use for Pydantic models, like different data types and additional validations with Field() . from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseSettings class Settings ( BaseSettings ): app_name : str = \"Awesome API\" admin_email : str items_per_user : int = 50 settings = Settings () app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/info\" ) async def info (): return { \"app_name\" : settings . app_name , \"admin_email\" : settings . admin_email , \"items_per_user\" : settings . items_per_user , } Tip If you want something quick to copy and paste, don't use this example, use the last one below. Then, when you create an instance of that Settings class (in this case, in the settings object), Pydantic will read the environment variables in a case-insensitive way, so, an upper-case variable APP_NAME will still be read for the attribute app_name . Next it will convert and validate the data. So, when you use that settings object, you will have data of the types you declared (e.g. items_per_user will be an int ). Use the settings \u00b6 Then you can use the new settings object in your application: from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseSettings class Settings ( BaseSettings ): app_name : str = \"Awesome API\" admin_email : str items_per_user : int = 50 settings = Settings () app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/info\" ) async def info (): return { \"app_name\" : settings . app_name , \"admin_email\" : settings . admin_email , \"items_per_user\" : settings . items_per_user , } Run the server \u00b6 Next, you would run the server passing the configurations as environment variables, for example you could set an ADMIN_EMAIL and APP_NAME with: $ ADMIN_EMAIL = \"deadpool@example.com\" APP_NAME = \"ChimichangApp\" uvicorn main:app <span style=\"color: green;\">INFO</span>: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit) Tip To set multiple env vars for a single command just separate them with a space, and put them all before the command. And then the admin_email setting would be set to \"deadpool@example.com\" . The app_name would be \"ChimichangApp\" . And the items_per_user would keep its default value of 50 . Settings in another module \u00b6 You could put those settings in another module file as you saw in Bigger Applications - Multiple Files . For example, you could have a file config.py with: from pydantic import BaseSettings class Settings ( BaseSettings ): app_name : str = \"Awesome API\" admin_email : str items_per_user : int = 50 settings = Settings () And then use it in a file main.py : from fastapi import FastAPI from .config import settings app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/info\" ) async def info (): return { \"app_name\" : settings . app_name , \"admin_email\" : settings . admin_email , \"items_per_user\" : settings . items_per_user , } Tip You would also need a file __init__.py as you saw on Bigger Applications - Multiple Files . Settings in a dependency \u00b6 In some occasions it might be useful to provide the settings from a dependency, instead of having a global object with settings that is used everywhere. This could be especially useful during testing, as it's very easy to override a dependency with your own custom settings. The config file \u00b6 Coming from the previous example, your config.py file could look like: from pydantic import BaseSettings class Settings ( BaseSettings ): app_name : str = \"Awesome API\" admin_email : str items_per_user : int = 50 Notice that now we don't create a default instance settings = Settings() . The main app file \u00b6 Now we create a dependency that returns a new config.Settings() . from functools import lru_cache from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI from .config import Settings app = FastAPI () @lru_cache () def get_settings (): return Settings () @app . get ( \"/info\" ) async def info ( settings : Settings = Depends ( get_settings )): return { \"app_name\" : settings . app_name , \"admin_email\" : settings . admin_email , \"items_per_user\" : settings . items_per_user , } Tip We'll discuss the @lru_cache() in a bit. For now you can assume get_settings() is a normal function. And then we can require it from the path operation function as a dependency and use it anywhere we need it. from functools import lru_cache from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI from .config import Settings app = FastAPI () @lru_cache () def get_settings (): return Settings () @app . get ( \"/info\" ) async def info ( settings : Settings = Depends ( get_settings )): return { \"app_name\" : settings . app_name , \"admin_email\" : settings . admin_email , \"items_per_user\" : settings . items_per_user , } Settings and testing \u00b6 Then it would be very easy to provide a different settings object during testing by creating a dependency override for get_settings : from fastapi.testclient import TestClient from .config import Settings from .main import app , get_settings client = TestClient ( app ) def get_settings_override (): return Settings ( admin_email = \"testing_admin@example.com\" ) app . dependency_overrides [ get_settings ] = get_settings_override def test_app (): response = client . get ( \"/info\" ) data = response . json () assert data == { \"app_name\" : \"Awesome API\" , \"admin_email\" : \"testing_admin@example.com\" , \"items_per_user\" : 50 , } In the dependency override we set a new value for the admin_email when creating the new Settings object, and then we return that new object. Then we can test that it is used. Reading a .env file \u00b6 If you have many settings that possibly change a lot, maybe in different environments, it might be useful to put them on a file and then read them from it as if they were environment variables. This practice is common enough that it has a name, these environment variables are commonly placed in a file .env , and the file is called a \"dotenv\". Tip A file starting with a dot ( . ) is a hidden file in Unix-like systems, like Linux and macOS. But a dotenv file doesn't really have to have that exact filename. Pydantic has support for reading from these types of files using an external library. You can read more at Pydantic Settings: Dotenv (.env) support . Tip For this to work, you need to pip install python-dotenv . The .env file \u00b6 You could have a .env file with: ADMIN_EMAIL = \"deadpool@example.com\" APP_NAME = \"ChimichangApp\" Read settings from .env \u00b6 And then update your config.py with: from pydantic import BaseSettings class Settings ( BaseSettings ): app_name : str = \"Awesome API\" admin_email : str items_per_user : int = 50 class Config : env_file = \".env\" Here we create a class Config inside of your Pydantic Settings class, and set the env_file to the filename with the dotenv file we want to use. Tip The Config class is used just for Pydantic configuration. You can read more at Pydantic Model Config Creating the Settings only once with lru_cache \u00b6 Reading a file from disk is normally a costly (slow) operation, so you probably want to do it only once and then re-use the same settings object, instead of reading it for each request. But every time we do: Settings () a new Settings object would be created, and at creation it would read the .env file again. If the dependency function was just like: def get_settings (): return Settings () we would create that object for each request, and we would be reading the .env file for each request. \u26a0\ufe0f But as we are using the @lru_cache() decorator on top, the Settings object will be created only once, the first time it's called. \u2714\ufe0f from functools import lru_cache from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI from . import config app = FastAPI () @lru_cache () def get_settings (): return config . Settings () @app . get ( \"/info\" ) async def info ( settings : config . Settings = Depends ( get_settings )): return { \"app_name\" : settings . app_name , \"admin_email\" : settings . admin_email , \"items_per_user\" : settings . items_per_user , } Then for any subsequent calls of get_settings() in the dependencies for the next requests, instead of executing the internal code of get_settings() and creating a new Settings object, it will return the same object that was returned on the first call, again and again. lru_cache Technical Details \u00b6 @lru_cache() modifies the function it decorates to return the same value that was returned the first time, instead of computing it again, executing the code of the function every time. So, the function below it will be executed once for each combination of arguments. And then the values returned by each of those combinations of arguments will be used again and again whenever the function is called with exactly the same combination of arguments. For example, if you have a function: @lru_cache () def say_hi ( name : str , salutation : str = \"Ms.\" ): return f \"Hello { salutation } { name } \" your program could execute like this: sequenceDiagram participant code as Code participant function as say_hi() participant execute as Execute function rect rgba(0, 255, 0, .1) code ->> function: say_hi(name=\"Camila\") function ->> execute: execute function code execute ->> code: return the result end rect rgba(0, 255, 255, .1) code ->> function: say_hi(name=\"Camila\") function ->> code: return stored result end rect rgba(0, 255, 0, .1) code ->> function: say_hi(name=\"Rick\") function ->> execute: execute function code execute ->> code: return the result end rect rgba(0, 255, 0, .1) code ->> function: say_hi(name=\"Rick\", salutation=\"Mr.\") function ->> execute: execute function code execute ->> code: return the result end rect rgba(0, 255, 255, .1) code ->> function: say_hi(name=\"Rick\") function ->> code: return stored result end rect rgba(0, 255, 255, .1) code ->> function: say_hi(name=\"Camila\") function ->> code: return stored result end In the case of our dependency get_settings() , the function doesn't even take any arguments, so it always returns the same value. That way, it behaves almost as if it was just a global variable. But as it uses a dependency function, then we can override it easily for testing. @lru_cache() is part of functools which is part of Python's standard library, you can read more about it in the Python docs for @lru_cache() . Recap \u00b6 You can use Pydantic Settings to handle the settings or configurations for your application, with all the power of Pydantic models. By using a dependency you can simplify testing. You can use .env files with it. Using @lru_cache() lets you avoid reading the dotenv file again and again for each request, while allowing you to override it during testing.","title":"Settings and Environment Variables"},{"location":"advanced/settings/#settings-and-environment-variables","text":"Warning The current page still doesn't have a translation for this language.

If you are developing an application with an older non-async framework, and can work with all its defaults, it can be a great tool . But if you need to change some of the defaults, support more than one predefined database, work with an async framework (like FastAPI), etc, you will need to add quite some complex extra code to override those defaults.

The standard Peewee code \u00b6 Let's first check all the normal Peewee code, create a Peewee database: from contextvars import ContextVar import peewee DATABASE_NAME = \"test.db\" db_state_default = { \"closed\" : None , \"conn\" : None , \"ctx\" : None , \"transactions\" : None } db_state = ContextVar ( \"db_state\" , default = db_state_default . copy ()) class PeeweeConnectionState ( peewee . _ConnectionState ): def __init__ ( self , ** kwargs ): super () . __setattr__ ( \"_state\" , db_state ) super () . __init__ ( ** kwargs ) def __setattr__ ( self , name , value ): self . _state . get ()[ name ] = value def __getattr__ ( self , name ): return self . _state . get ()[ name ] db = peewee . SqliteDatabase ( DATABASE_NAME , check_same_thread = False ) db . _state = PeeweeConnectionState () Tip Have in mind that if you wanted to use a different database, like PostgreSQL, you couldn't just change the string. You would need to use a different Peewee database class. Note \u00b6 The argument: check_same_thread = False is equivalent to the one in the SQLAlchemy tutorial: connect_args = { \"check_same_thread\" : False } ...it is needed only for SQLite . Technical Details Exactly the same technical details as in SQL (Relational) Databases apply. Make Peewee async-compatible PeeweeConnectionState \u00b6 The main issue with Peewee and FastAPI is that Peewee relies heavily on Python's threading.local , and it doesn't have a direct way to override it or let you handle connections/sessions directly (as is done in the SQLAlchemy tutorial). And threading.local is not compatible with the new async features of modern Python. Technical Details threading.local is used to have a \"magic\" variable that has a different value for each thread. This was useful in older frameworks designed to have one single thread per request, no more, no less. Using this, each request would have its own database connection/session, which is the actual final goal. But FastAPI, using the new async features, could handle more than one request on the same thread. And at the same time, for a single request, it could run multiple things in different threads (in a threadpool), depending on if you use async def or normal def . This is what gives all the performance improvements to FastAPI. But Python 3.7 and above provide a more advanced alternative to threading.local , that can also be used in the places where threading.local would be used, but is compatible with the new async features. We are going to use that. It's called contextvars . We are going to override the internal parts of Peewee that use threading.local and replace them with contextvars , with the corresponding updates. This might seem a bit complex (and it actually is), you don't really need to completely understand how it works to use it. We will create a PeeweeConnectionState : from contextvars import ContextVar import peewee DATABASE_NAME = \"test.db\" db_state_default = { \"closed\" : None , \"conn\" : None , \"ctx\" : None , \"transactions\" : None } db_state = ContextVar ( \"db_state\" , default = db_state_default . copy ()) class PeeweeConnectionState ( peewee . _ConnectionState ): def __init__ ( self , ** kwargs ): super () . __setattr__ ( \"_state\" , db_state ) super () . __init__ ( ** kwargs ) def __setattr__ ( self , name , value ): self . _state . get ()[ name ] = value def __getattr__ ( self , name ): return self . _state . get ()[ name ] db = peewee . SqliteDatabase ( DATABASE_NAME , check_same_thread = False ) db . _state = PeeweeConnectionState () This class inherits from a special internal class used by Peewee. It has all the logic to make Peewee use contextvars instead of threading.local . contextvars works a bit differently than threading.local . But the rest of Peewee's internal code assumes that this class works with threading.local . So, we need to do some extra tricks to make it work as if it was just using threading.local . The __init__ , __setattr__ , and __getattr__ implement all the required tricks for this to be used by Peewee without knowing that it is now compatible with FastAPI. Tip This will just make Peewee behave correctly when used with FastAPI. Not randomly opening or closing connections that are being used, creating errors, etc. But it doesn't give Peewee async super-powers. You should still use normal def functions and not async def . Use the custom PeeweeConnectionState class \u00b6 Now, overwrite the ._state internal attribute in the Peewee database db object using the new PeeweeConnectionState : from contextvars import ContextVar import peewee DATABASE_NAME = \"test.db\" db_state_default = { \"closed\" : None , \"conn\" : None , \"ctx\" : None , \"transactions\" : None } db_state = ContextVar ( \"db_state\" , default = db_state_default . copy ()) class PeeweeConnectionState ( peewee . _ConnectionState ): def __init__ ( self , ** kwargs ): super () . __setattr__ ( \"_state\" , db_state ) super () . __init__ ( ** kwargs ) def __setattr__ ( self , name , value ): self . _state . get ()[ name ] = value def __getattr__ ( self , name ): return self . _state . get ()[ name ] db = peewee . SqliteDatabase ( DATABASE_NAME , check_same_thread = False ) db . _state = PeeweeConnectionState () Tip Make sure you overwrite db._state after creating db . Tip You would do the same for any other Peewee database, including PostgresqlDatabase , MySQLDatabase , etc. Create the database models \u00b6 Let's now see the file sql_app/models.py . Create Peewee models for our data \u00b6 Now create the Peewee models (classes) for User and Item . This is the same you would do if you followed the Peewee tutorial and updated the models to have the same data as in the SQLAlchemy tutorial. Tip Peewee also uses the term \" model \" to refer to these classes and instances that interact with the database. But Pydantic also uses the term \" model \" to refer to something different, the data validation, conversion, and documentation classes and instances. Import db from database (the file database.py from above) and use it here. import peewee from .database import db class User ( peewee . Model ): email = peewee . CharField ( unique = True , index = True ) hashed_password = peewee . CharField () is_active = peewee . BooleanField ( default = True ) class Meta : database = db class Item ( peewee . Model ): title = peewee . CharField ( index = True ) description = peewee . CharField ( index = True ) owner = peewee . ForeignKeyField ( User , backref = \"items\" ) class Meta : database = db Tip Peewee creates several magic attributes. It will automatically add an id attribute as an integer to be the primary key. It will chose the name of the tables based on the class names. For the Item , it will create an attribute owner_id with the integer ID of the User . But we don't declare it anywhere. Create the Pydantic models \u00b6 Now let's check the file sql_app/schemas.py . Tip To avoid confusion between the Peewee models and the Pydantic models , we will have the file models.py with the Peewee models, and the file schemas.py with the Pydantic models. These Pydantic models define more or less a \"schema\" (a valid data shape). So this will help us avoiding confusion while using both. Create the Pydantic models / schemas \u00b6 Create all the same Pydantic models as in the SQLAlchemy tutorial: from typing import Any , List , Union import peewee from pydantic import BaseModel from pydantic.utils import GetterDict class PeeweeGetterDict ( GetterDict ): def get ( self , key : Any , default : Any = None ): res = getattr ( self . _obj , key , default ) if isinstance ( res , peewee . ModelSelect ): return list ( res ) return res class ItemBase ( BaseModel ): title : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None class ItemCreate ( ItemBase ): pass class Item ( ItemBase ): id : int owner_id : int class Config : orm_mode = True getter_dict = PeeweeGetterDict class UserBase ( BaseModel ): email : str class UserCreate ( UserBase ): password : str class User ( UserBase ): id : int is_active : bool items : List [ Item ] = [] class Config : orm_mode = True getter_dict = PeeweeGetterDict Tip Here we are creating the models with an id . We didn't explicitly specify an id attribute in the Peewee models, but Peewee adds one automatically. We are also adding the magic owner_id attribute to Item . Create a PeeweeGetterDict for the Pydantic models / schemas \u00b6 When you access a relationship in a Peewee object, like in some_user.items , Peewee doesn't provide a list of Item . It provides a special custom object of class ModelSelect . It's possible to create a list of its items with list(some_user.items) . But the object itself is not a list . And it's also not an actual Python generator . Because of this, Pydantic doesn't know by default how to convert it to a list of Pydantic models / schemas. But recent versions of Pydantic allow providing a custom class that inherits from pydantic.utils.GetterDict , to provide the functionality used when using the orm_mode = True to retrieve the values for ORM model attributes. We are going to create a custom PeeweeGetterDict class and use it in all the same Pydantic models / schemas that use orm_mode : from typing import Any , List , Union import peewee from pydantic import BaseModel from pydantic.utils import GetterDict class PeeweeGetterDict ( GetterDict ): def get ( self , key : Any , default : Any = None ): res = getattr ( self . _obj , key , default ) if isinstance ( res , peewee . ModelSelect ): return list ( res ) return res class ItemBase ( BaseModel ): title : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None class ItemCreate ( ItemBase ): pass class Item ( ItemBase ): id : int owner_id : int class Config : orm_mode = True getter_dict = PeeweeGetterDict class UserBase ( BaseModel ): email : str class UserCreate ( UserBase ): password : str class User ( UserBase ): id : int is_active : bool items : List [ Item ] = [] class Config : orm_mode = True getter_dict = PeeweeGetterDict Here we are checking if the attribute that is being accessed (e.g. .items in some_user.items ) is an instance of peewee.ModelSelect . And if that's the case, just return a list with it. And then we use it in the Pydantic models / schemas that use orm_mode = True , with the configuration variable getter_dict = PeeweeGetterDict . Tip We only need to create one PeeweeGetterDict class, and we can use it in all the Pydantic models / schemas. CRUD utils \u00b6 Now let's see the file sql_app/crud.py . Create all the CRUD utils \u00b6 Create all the same CRUD utils as in the SQLAlchemy tutorial, all the code is very similar: from . import models , schemas def get_user ( user_id : int ): return models . User . filter ( models . User . id == user_id ) . first () def get_user_by_email ( email : str ): return models . User . filter ( models . User . email == email ) . first () def get_users ( skip : int = 0 , limit : int = 100 ): return list ( models . User . select () . offset ( skip ) . limit ( limit )) def create_user ( user : schemas . UserCreate ): fake_hashed_password = user . password + \"notreallyhashed\" db_user = models . User ( email = user . email , hashed_password = fake_hashed_password ) db_user . save () return db_user def get_items ( skip : int = 0 , limit : int = 100 ): return list ( models . Item . select () . offset ( skip ) . limit ( limit )) def create_user_item ( item : schemas . ItemCreate , user_id : int ): db_item = models . Item ( ** item . dict (), owner_id = user_id ) db_item . save () return db_item There are some differences with the code for the SQLAlchemy tutorial. We don't pass a db attribute around. Instead we use the models directly. This is because the db object is a global object, that includes all the connection logic. That's why we had to do all the contextvars updates above. Aso, when returning several objects, like in get_users , we directly call list , like in: list ( models . User . select ()) This is for the same reason that we had to create a custom PeeweeGetterDict . But by returning something that is already a list instead of the peewee.ModelSelect the response_model in the path operation with List[models.User] (that we'll see later) will work correctly. Main FastAPI app \u00b6 And now in the file sql_app/main.py let's integrate and use all the other parts we created before. Create the database tables \u00b6 In a very simplistic way create the database tables: import time from typing import List from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI , HTTPException from . import crud , database , models , schemas from .database import db_state_default database . db . connect () database . db . create_tables ([ models . User , models . Item ]) database . db . close () app = FastAPI () sleep_time = 10 async def reset_db_state (): database . db . _state . _state . set ( db_state_default . copy ()) database . db . _state . reset () def get_db ( db_state = Depends ( reset_db_state )): try : database . db . connect () yield finally : if not database . db . is_closed (): database . db . close () @app . post ( \"/users/\" , response_model = schemas . User , dependencies = [ Depends ( get_db )]) def create_user ( user : schemas . UserCreate ): db_user = crud . get_user_by_email ( email = user . email ) if db_user : raise HTTPException ( status_code = 400 , detail = \"Email already registered\" ) return crud . create_user ( user = user ) @app . get ( \"/users/\" , response_model = List [ schemas . User ], dependencies = [ Depends ( get_db )]) def read_users ( skip : int = 0 , limit : int = 100 ): users = crud . get_users ( skip = skip , limit = limit ) return users @app . get ( \"/users/ {user_id} \" , response_model = schemas .

Item , dependencies = [ Depends ( get_db )], ) def create_item_for_user ( user_id : int , item : schemas . ItemCreate ): return crud . create_user_item ( item = item , user_id = user_id ) @app . get ( \"/items/\" , response_model = List [ schemas . Item ], dependencies = [ Depends ( get_db )]) def read_items ( skip : int = 0 , limit : int = 100 ): items = crud . get_items ( skip = skip , limit = limit ) return items @app . get ( \"/slowusers/\" , response_model = List [ schemas . User ], dependencies = [ Depends ( get_db )] ) def read_slow_users ( skip : int = 0 , limit : int = 100 ): global sleep_time sleep_time = max ( 0 , sleep_time - 1 ) time . sleep ( sleep_time ) # Fake long processing request users = crud . get_users ( skip = skip , limit = limit ) return users Create a dependency \u00b6 Create a dependency that will connect the database right at the beginning of a request and disconnect it at the end: import time from typing import List from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI , HTTPException from . import crud , database , models , schemas from .database import db_state_default database . db . connect () database . db . create_tables ([ models . User , models . Item ]) database . db . close () app = FastAPI () sleep_time = 10 async def reset_db_state (): database . db . _state . _state . set ( db_state_default . copy ()) database . db . _state . reset () def get_db ( db_state = Depends ( reset_db_state )): try : database . db . connect () yield finally : if not database . db . is_closed (): database . db . close () @app . post ( \"/users/\" , response_model = schemas . User , dependencies = [ Depends ( get_db )]) def create_user ( user : schemas . UserCreate ): db_user = crud . get_user_by_email ( email = user . email ) if db_user : raise HTTPException ( status_code = 400 , detail = \"Email already registered\" ) return crud . create_user ( user = user ) @app . get ( \"/users/\" , response_model = List [ schemas .

User , dependencies = [ Depends ( get_db )] ) def read_user ( user_id : int ): db_user = crud . get_user ( user_id = user_id ) if db_user is None : raise HTTPException ( status_code = 404 , detail = \"User not found\" ) return db_user @app . post ( \"/users/ {user_id} /items/\" , response_model = schemas . Item , dependencies = [ Depends ( get_db )], ) def create_item_for_user ( user_id : int , item : schemas . ItemCreate ): return crud . create_user_item ( item = item , user_id = user_id ) @app . get ( \"/items/\" , response_model = List [ schemas . Item ], dependencies = [ Depends ( get_db )]) def read_items ( skip : int = 0 , limit : int = 100 ): items = crud . get_items ( skip = skip , limit = limit ) return items @app . get ( \"/slowusers/\" , response_model = List [ schemas .

It is connecting to the database and storing the connection data in an internal variable that is independent for each request (using the contextvars tricks from above). Because the database connection is potentially I/O blocking, this dependency is created with a normal def function. And then, in each path operation function that needs to access the database we add it as a dependency. But we are not using the value given by this dependency (it actually doesn't give any value, as it has an empty yield ). So, we don't add it to the path operation function but to the path operation decorator in the dependencies parameter: import time from typing import List from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI , HTTPException from . import crud , database , models , schemas from .database import db_state_default database . db . connect () database . db . create_tables ([ models .

For that, we need to create another async dependency reset_db_state() that is used as a sub-dependency in get_db() . It will set the value for the context variable (with just a default dict ) that will be used as the database state for the whole request. And then the dependency get_db() will store in it the database state (connection, transactions, etc). import time from typing import List from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI , HTTPException from . import crud , database , models , schemas from .database import db_state_default database . db . connect () database . db . create_tables ([ models .

Tip As FastAPI is an async framework, one request could start being processed, and before finishing, another request could be received and start processing as well, and it all could be processed in the same thread. But context variables are aware of these async features, so, a Peewee database state set in the async dependency reset_db_state() will keep its own data throughout the entire request. And at the same time, the other concurrent request will have its own database state that will be independent for the whole request. Peewee Proxy \u00b6 If you are using a Peewee Proxy , the actual database is at db.obj . So, you would reset it with: async def reset_db_state (): database . db . obj . _state . _state . set ( db_state_default . copy ()) database . db . obj . _state . reset () Create your FastAPI path operations \u00b6 Now, finally, here's the standard FastAPI path operations code. import time from typing import List from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI , HTTPException from . import crud , database , models , schemas from .database import db_state_default database . db . connect () database . db . create_tables ([ models . User , models .

User ], dependencies = [ Depends ( get_db )]) def read_users ( skip : int = 0 , limit : int = 100 ): users = crud . get_users ( skip = skip , limit = limit ) return users @app . get ( \"/users/ {user_id} \" , response_model = schemas .

User ], dependencies = [ Depends ( get_db )] ) def read_slow_users ( skip : int = 0 , limit : int = 100 ): global sleep_time sleep_time = max ( 0 , sleep_time - 1 ) time . sleep ( sleep_time ) # Fake long processing request users = crud . get_users ( skip = skip , limit = limit ) return users About def vs async def \u00b6 The same as with SQLAlchemy, we are not doing something like: user = await models . User . select () . first () ...but instead we are using: user = models . User . select () . first () So, again, we should declare the path operation functions and the dependency without async def , just with a normal def , as: # Something goes here def read_users ( skip : int = 0 , limit : int = 100 ): # Something goes here Testing Peewee with async \u00b6 This example includes an extra path operation that simulates a long processing request with time.sleep(sleep_time) . It will have the database connection open at the beginning and will just wait some seconds before replying back. And each new request will wait one second less. This will easily let you test that your app with Peewee and FastAPI is behaving correctly with all the stuff about threads. If you want to check how Peewee would break your app if used without modification, go the the sql_app/database.py file and comment the line: # db._state = PeeweeConnectionState() And in the file sql_app/main.py file, comment the body of the async dependency reset_db_state() and replace it with a pass : async def reset_db_state (): # database.db._state._state.set(db_state_default.copy()) # database.db._state.reset() pass Then run your app with Uvicorn: $ uvicorn sql_app.main:app --reload <span style=\"color: green;\">INFO</span>: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit) Open your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs and create a couple of users. Then open 10 tabs at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs#/default/read_slow_users_slowusers__get at the same time. Go to the path operation \"Get /slowusers/ \" in all of the tabs. Use the \"Try it out\" button and execute the request in each tab, one right after the other. The tabs will wait for a bit and then some of them will show Internal Server Error . What happens \u00b6 The first tab will make your app create a connection to the database and wait for some seconds before replying back and closing the database connection. Then, for the request in the next tab, your app will wait for one second less, and so on. This means that it will end up finishing some of the last tabs' requests earlier than some of the previous ones. Then one the last requests that wait less seconds will try to open a database connection, but as one of those previous requests for the other tabs will probably be handled in the same thread as the first one, it will have the same database connection that is already open, and Peewee will throw an error and you will see it in the terminal, and the response will have an Internal Server Error . This will probably happen for more than one of those tabs. If you had multiple clients talking to your app exactly at the same time, this is what could happen. And as your app starts to handle more and more clients at the same time, the waiting time in a single request needs to be shorter and shorter to trigger the error. Fix Peewee with FastAPI \u00b6 Now go back to the file sql_app/database.py , and uncomment the line: db . _state = PeeweeConnectionState () And in the file sql_app/main.py file, uncomment the body of the async dependency reset_db_state() : async def reset_db_state (): database . db . _state . _state . set ( db_state_default . copy ()) database . db . _state . reset () Terminate your running app and start it again.

The problem \u00b6 Peewee uses threading.local by default to store it's database \"state\" data (connection, transactions, etc). threading.local creates a value exclusive to the current thread, but an async framework would run all the code (e.g. for each request) in the same thread, and possibly not in order. On top of that, an async framework could run some sync code in a threadpool (using asyncio.run_in_executor ), but belonging to the same request. This means that, with Peewee's current implementation, multiple tasks could be using the same threading.local variable and end up sharing the same connection and data (that they shouldn't), and at the same time, if they execute sync I/O-blocking code in a threadpool (as with normal def functions in FastAPI, in path operations and dependencies), that code won't have access to the database state variables, even while it's part of the same request and it should be able to get access to the same database state. Context variables \u00b6 Python 3.7 has contextvars that can create a local variable very similar to threading.local , but also supporting these async features. There are several things to have in mind. The ContextVar has to be created at the top of the module, like: some_var = ContextVar ( \"some_var\" , default = \"default value\" ) To set a value used in the current \"context\" (e.g. for the current request) use: some_var . set ( \"new value\" ) To get a value anywhere inside of the context (e.g. in any part handling the current request) use: some_var . get () Set context variables in the async dependency reset_db_state() \u00b6 If some part of the async code sets the value with some_var.set(\"updated in function\") (e.g. like the async dependency), the rest of the code in it and the code that goes after (including code inside of async functions called with await ) will see that new value. So, in our case, if we set the Peewee state variable (with a default dict ) in the async dependency, all the rest of the internal code in our app will see this value and will be able to reuse it for the whole request. And the context variable would be set again for the next request, even if they are concurrent. Set database state in the dependency get_db() \u00b6 As get_db() is a normal def function, FastAPI will make it run in a threadpool, with a copy of the \"context\", holding the same value for the context variable (the dict with the reset database state). Then it can add database state to that dict , like the connection, etc. But if the value of the context variable (the default dict ) was set in that normal def function, it would create a new value that would stay only in that thread of the threadpool, and the rest of the code (like the path operation functions ) wouldn't have access to it. In get_db() we can only set values in the dict , but not the entire dict itself. So, we need to have the async dependency reset_db_state() to set the dict in the context variable. That way, all the code has access to the same dict for the database state for a single request. Connect and disconnect in the dependency get_db() \u00b6 Then the next question would be, why not just connect and disconnect the database in the async dependency itself, instead of in get_db() ? The async dependency has to be async for the context variable to be preserved for the rest of the request, but creating and closing the database connection is potentially blocking, so it could degrade performance if it was there. So we also need the normal def dependency get_db() .","title":"SQL (Relational) Databases with Peewee"},{"location":"advanced/sql-databases-peewee/#sql-relational-databases-with-peewee","text":"Warning The current page still doesn't have a translation for this language.

And threading.local is not compatible with the new async features of modern Python. Technical Details threading.local is used to have a \"magic\" variable that has a different value for each thread. This was useful in older frameworks designed to have one single thread per request, no more, no less. Using this, each request would have its own database connection/session, which is the actual final goal. But FastAPI, using the new async features, could handle more than one request on the same thread. And at the same time, for a single request, it could run multiple things in different threads (in a threadpool), depending on if you use async def or normal def . This is what gives all the performance improvements to FastAPI. But Python 3.7 and above provide a more advanced alternative to threading.local , that can also be used in the places where threading.local would be used, but is compatible with the new async features. We are going to use that. It's called contextvars . We are going to override the internal parts of Peewee that use threading.local and replace them with contextvars , with the corresponding updates. This might seem a bit complex (and it actually is), you don't really need to completely understand how it works to use it. We will create a PeeweeConnectionState : from contextvars import ContextVar import peewee DATABASE_NAME = \"test.db\" db_state_default = { \"closed\" : None , \"conn\" : None , \"ctx\" : None , \"transactions\" : None } db_state = ContextVar ( \"db_state\" , default = db_state_default . copy ()) class PeeweeConnectionState ( peewee . _ConnectionState ): def __init__ ( self , ** kwargs ): super () . __setattr__ ( \"_state\" , db_state ) super () . __init__ ( ** kwargs ) def __setattr__ ( self , name , value ): self . _state . get ()[ name ] = value def __getattr__ ( self , name ): return self . _state . get ()[ name ] db = peewee . SqliteDatabase ( DATABASE_NAME , check_same_thread = False ) db . _state = PeeweeConnectionState () This class inherits from a special internal class used by Peewee. It has all the logic to make Peewee use contextvars instead of threading.local . contextvars works a bit differently than threading.local . But the rest of Peewee's internal code assumes that this class works with threading.local . So, we need to do some extra tricks to make it work as if it was just using threading.local . The __init__ , __setattr__ , and __getattr__ implement all the required tricks for this to be used by Peewee without knowing that it is now compatible with FastAPI. Tip This will just make Peewee behave correctly when used with FastAPI. Not randomly opening or closing connections that are being used, creating errors, etc. But it doesn't give Peewee async super-powers.

But you can help translating it: Contributing . Overriding dependencies during testing \u00b6 There are some scenarios where you might want to override a dependency during testing. You don't want the original dependency to run (nor any of the sub-dependencies it might have). Instead, you want to provide a different dependency that will be used only during tests (possibly only some specific tests), and will provide a value that can be used where the value of the original dependency was used. Use cases: external service \u00b6 An example could be that you have an external authentication provider that you need to call. You send it a token and it returns an authenticated user. This provider might be charging you per request, and calling it might take some extra time than if you had a fixed mock user for tests. You probably want to test the external provider once, but not necessarily call it for every test that runs. In this case, you can override the dependency that calls that provider, and use a custom dependency that returns a mock user, only for your tests. Use the app.dependency_overrides attribute \u00b6 For these cases, your FastAPI application has an attribute app.dependency_overrides , it is a simple dict . To override a dependency for testing, you put as a key the original dependency (a function), and as the value, your dependency override (another function). And then FastAPI will call that override instead of the original dependency. from typing import Union from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI from fastapi.testclient import TestClient app = FastAPI () async def common_parameters ( q : Union [ str , None ] = None , skip : int = 0 , limit : int = 100 ): return { \"q\" : q , \"skip\" : skip , \"limit\" : limit } @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( commons : dict = Depends ( common_parameters )): return { \"message\" : \"Hello Items!\" , \"params\" : commons } @app . get ( \"/users/\" ) async def read_users ( commons : dict = Depends ( common_parameters )): return { \"message\" : \"Hello Users!\" , \"params\" : commons } client = TestClient ( app ) async def override_dependency ( q : Union [ str , None ] = None ): return { \"q\" : q , \"skip\" : 5 , \"limit\" : 10 } app . dependency_overrides [ common_parameters ] = override_dependency def test_override_in_items (): response = client . get ( \"/items/\" ) assert response . status_code == 200 assert response . json () == { \"message\" : \"Hello Items!\" , \"params\" : { \"q\" : None , \"skip\" : 5 , \"limit\" : 10 }, } def test_override_in_items_with_q (): response = client . get ( \"/items/?q=foo\" ) assert response . status_code == 200 assert response . json () == { \"message\" : \"Hello Items!\" , \"params\" : { \"q\" : \"foo\" , \"skip\" : 5 , \"limit\" : 10 }, } def test_override_in_items_with_params (): response = client . get ( \"/items/?q=foo&skip=100&limit=200\" ) assert response . status_code == 200 assert response . json () == { \"message\" : \"Hello Items!\" , \"params\" : { \"q\" : \"foo\" , \"skip\" : 5 , \"limit\" : 10 }, } Tip You can set a dependency override for a dependency used anywhere in your FastAPI application. The original dependency could be used in a path operation function , a path operation decorator (when you don't use the return value), a .include_router() call, etc. FastAPI will still be able to override it. Then you can reset your overrides (remove them) by setting app.dependency_overrides to be an empty dict : app . dependency_overrides = {} Tip If you want to override a dependency only during some tests, you can set the override at the beginning of the test (inside the test function) and reset it at the end (at the end of the test function).","title":"Testing Dependencies with Overrides"},{"location":"advanced/testing-dependencies/#testing-dependencies-with-overrides","text":"Warning The current page still doesn't have a translation for this language.

So it's better to close the WebSocket connection directly. You can use a closing code from the valid codes defined in the specification . In the future, there will be a WebSocketException that you will be able to raise from anywhere, and add exception handlers for it. It depends on the PR #527 in Starlette.

There you can set: The \"Item ID\", used in the path. The \"Token\" used as a query parameter. Tip Notice that the query token will be handled by a dependency. With that you can connect the WebSocket and then send and receive messages: Handling disconnections and multiple clients \u00b6 When a WebSocket connection is closed, the await websocket.receive_text() will raise a WebSocketDisconnect exception, which you can then catch and handle like in this example. from typing import List from fastapi import FastAPI , WebSocket , WebSocketDisconnect from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse app = FastAPI () html = \"\"\" <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>Chat</title> </head> <body> <h1>WebSocket Chat</h1> <h2>Your ID: <span id=\"ws-id\"></span></h2> <form action=\"\" onsubmit=\"sendMessage(event)\"> <input type=\"text\" id=\"messageText\" autocomplete=\"off\"/> <button>Send</button> </form> <ul id='messages'> </ul> <script> var client_id = Date.now() document.querySelector(\"#ws-id\").textContent = client_id; var ws = new WebSocket(`ws://localhost:8000/ws/$ {client_id} `); ws.onmessage = function(event) { var messages = document.getElementById('messages') var message = document.createElement('li') var content = document.createTextNode(event.data) message.appendChild(content) messages.appendChild(message) }; function sendMessage(event) { var input = document.getElementById(\"messageText\") ws.send(input.value) input.value = '' event.preventDefault() } </script> </body> </html> \"\"\" class ConnectionManager : def __init__ ( self ): self . active_connections : List [ WebSocket ] = [] async def connect ( self , websocket : WebSocket ): await websocket . accept () self . active_connections . append ( websocket ) def disconnect ( self , websocket : WebSocket ): self . active_connections . remove ( websocket ) async def send_personal_message ( self , message : str , websocket : WebSocket ): await websocket . send_text ( message ) async def broadcast ( self , message : str ): for connection in self . active_connections : await connection . send_text ( message ) manager = ConnectionManager () @app . get ( \"/\" ) async def get (): return HTMLResponse ( html ) @app . websocket ( \"/ws/ {client_id} \" ) async def websocket_endpoint ( websocket : WebSocket , client_id : int ): await manager . connect ( websocket ) try : while True : data = await websocket . receive_text () await manager . send_personal_message ( f \"You wrote: { data } \" , websocket ) await manager . broadcast ( f \"Client # { client_id } says: { data } \" ) except WebSocketDisconnect : manager . disconnect ( websocket ) await manager . broadcast ( f \"Client # { client_id } left the chat\" ) To try it out: Open the app with several browser tabs. Write messages from them. Then close one of the tabs. That will raise the WebSocketDisconnect exception, and all the other clients will receive a message like: Client #1596980209979 left the chat Tip The app above is a minimal and simple example to demonstrate how to handle and broadcast messages to several WebSocket connections. But have in mind that, as everything is handled in memory, in a single list, it will only work while the process is running, and will only work with a single process.

But you can help translating it: Contributing . You can use OAuth2 scopes directly with FastAPI , they are integrated to work seamlessly. This would allow you to have a more fine-grained permission system, following the OAuth2 standard, integrated into your OpenAPI application (and the API docs). OAuth2 with scopes is the mechanism used by many big authentication providers, like Facebook, Google, GitHub, Microsoft, Twitter, etc. They use it to provide specific permissions to users and applications. Every time you \"log in with\" Facebook, Google, GitHub, Microsoft, Twitter, that application is using OAuth2 with scopes. In this section you will see how to manage authentication and authorization with the same OAuth2 with scopes in your FastAPI application. Warning This is a more or less advanced section. If you are just starting, you can skip it. You don't necessarily need OAuth2 scopes, and you can handle authentication and authorization however you want. But OAuth2 with scopes can be nicely integrated into your API (with OpenAPI) and your API docs. Nevertheless, you still enforce those scopes, or any other security/authorization requirement, however you need, in your code. In many cases, OAuth2 with scopes can be an overkill. But if you know you need it, or you are curious, keep reading. OAuth2 scopes and OpenAPI \u00b6 The OAuth2 specification defines \"scopes\" as a list of strings separated by spaces. The content of each of these strings can have any format, but should not contain spaces. These scopes represent \"permissions\". In OpenAPI (e.g. the API docs), you can define \"security schemes\". When one of these security schemes uses OAuth2, you can also declare and use scopes. Each \"scope\" is just a string (without spaces). They are normally used to declare specific security permissions, for example: users:read or users:write are common examples. instagram_basic is used by Facebook / Instagram. https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive is used by Google. Info In OAuth2 a \"scope\" is just a string that declares a specific permission required. It doesn't matter if it has other characters like : or if it is a URL. Those details are implementation specific. For OAuth2 they are just strings.

OAuth2 Security scheme \u00b6 The first change is that now we are declaring the OAuth2 security scheme with two available scopes, me and items . The scopes parameter receives a dict with each scope as a key and the description as the value: from datetime import datetime , timedelta from typing import List , Union from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI , HTTPException , Security , status from fastapi.security import ( OAuth2PasswordBearer , OAuth2PasswordRequestForm , SecurityScopes , ) from jose import JWTError , jwt from passlib.context import CryptContext from pydantic import BaseModel , ValidationError # to get a string like this run: # openssl rand -hex 32 SECRET_KEY = \"09d25e094faa6ca2556c818166b7a9563b93f7099f6f0f4caa6cf63b88e8d3e7\" ALGORITHM = \"HS256\" ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES = 30 fake_users_db = { \"johndoe\" : { \"username\" : \"johndoe\" , \"full_name\" : \"John Doe\" , \"email\" : \"johndoe@example.com\" , \"hashed_password\" : \"$2b$12$EixZaYVK1fsbw1ZfbX3OXePaWxn96p36WQoeG6Lruj3vjPGga31lW\" , \"disabled\" : False , }, \"alice\" : { \"username\" : \"alice\" , \"full_name\" : \"Alice Chains\" , \"email\" : \"alicechains@example.com\" , \"hashed_password\" : \"$2b$12$gSvqqUPvlXP2tfVFaWK1Be7DlH.PKZbv5H8KnzzVgXXbVxpva.pFm\" , \"disabled\" : True , }, } class Token ( BaseModel ): access_token : str token_type : str class TokenData ( BaseModel ): username : Union [ str , None ] = None scopes : List [ str ] = [] class User ( BaseModel ): username : str email : Union [ str , None ] = None full_name : Union [ str , None ] = None disabled : Union [ bool , None ] = None class UserInDB ( User ): hashed_password : str pwd_context = CryptContext ( schemes = [ \"bcrypt\" ], deprecated = \"auto\" ) oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer ( tokenUrl = \"token\" , scopes = { \"me\" : \"Read information about the current user.\" , \"items\" : \"Read items.\" }, ) app = FastAPI () def verify_password ( plain_password , hashed_password ): return pwd_context . verify ( plain_password , hashed_password ) def get_password_hash ( password ): return pwd_context . hash ( password ) def get_user ( db , username : str ): if username in db : user_dict = db [ username ] return UserInDB ( ** user_dict ) def authenticate_user ( fake_db , username : str , password : str ): user = get_user ( fake_db , username ) if not user : return False if not verify_password ( password , user . hashed_password ): return False return user def create_access_token ( data : dict , expires_delta : Union [ timedelta , None ] = None ): to_encode = data . copy () if expires_delta : expire = datetime . utcnow () + expires_delta else : expire = datetime . utcnow () + timedelta ( minutes = 15 ) to_encode . update ({ \"exp\" : expire }) encoded_jwt = jwt . encode ( to_encode , SECRET_KEY , algorithm = ALGORITHM ) return encoded_jwt async def get_current_user ( security_scopes : SecurityScopes , token : str = Depends ( oauth2_scheme ) ): if security_scopes . scopes : authenticate_value = f 'Bearer scope=\" { security_scopes . scope_str } \"' else : authenticate_value = f \"Bearer\" credentials_exception = HTTPException ( status_code = status .

And you will be able to select which scopes you want to give access to: me and items . This is the same mechanism used when you give permissions while logging in with Facebook, Google, GitHub, etc: JWT token with scopes \u00b6 Now, modify the token path operation to return the scopes requested. We are still using the same OAuth2PasswordRequestForm . It includes a property scopes with a list of str , with each scope it received in the request. And we return the scopes as part of the JWT token. Danger For simplicity, here we are just adding the scopes received directly to the token. But in your application, for security, you should make sure you only add the scopes that the user is actually able to have, or the ones you have predefined. from datetime import datetime , timedelta from typing import List , Union from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI , HTTPException , Security , status from fastapi.security import ( OAuth2PasswordBearer , OAuth2PasswordRequestForm , SecurityScopes , ) from jose import JWTError , jwt from passlib.context import CryptContext from pydantic import BaseModel , ValidationError # to get a string like this run: # openssl rand -hex 32 SECRET_KEY = \"09d25e094faa6ca2556c818166b7a9563b93f7099f6f0f4caa6cf63b88e8d3e7\" ALGORITHM = \"HS256\" ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES = 30 fake_users_db = { \"johndoe\" : { \"username\" : \"johndoe\" , \"full_name\" : \"John Doe\" , \"email\" : \"johndoe@example.com\" , \"hashed_password\" : \"$2b$12$EixZaYVK1fsbw1ZfbX3OXePaWxn96p36WQoeG6Lruj3vjPGga31lW\" , \"disabled\" : False , }, \"alice\" : { \"username\" : \"alice\" , \"full_name\" : \"Alice Chains\" , \"email\" : \"alicechains@example.com\" , \"hashed_password\" : \"$2b$12$gSvqqUPvlXP2tfVFaWK1Be7DlH.PKZbv5H8KnzzVgXXbVxpva.pFm\" , \"disabled\" : True , }, } class Token ( BaseModel ): access_token : str token_type : str class TokenData ( BaseModel ): username : Union [ str , None ] = None scopes : List [ str ] = [] class User ( BaseModel ): username : str email : Union [ str , None ] = None full_name : Union [ str , None ] = None disabled : Union [ bool , None ] = None class UserInDB ( User ): hashed_password : str pwd_context = CryptContext ( schemes = [ \"bcrypt\" ], deprecated = \"auto\" ) oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer ( tokenUrl = \"token\" , scopes = { \"me\" : \"Read information about the current user.\" , \"items\" : \"Read items.\" }, ) app = FastAPI () def verify_password ( plain_password , hashed_password ): return pwd_context . verify ( plain_password , hashed_password ) def get_password_hash ( password ): return pwd_context . hash ( password ) def get_user ( db , username : str ): if username in db : user_dict = db [ username ] return UserInDB ( ** user_dict ) def authenticate_user ( fake_db , username : str , password : str ): user = get_user ( fake_db , username ) if not user : return False if not verify_password ( password , user . hashed_password ): return False return user def create_access_token ( data : dict , expires_delta : Union [ timedelta , None ] = None ): to_encode = data . copy () if expires_delta : expire = datetime . utcnow () + expires_delta else : expire = datetime . utcnow () + timedelta ( minutes = 15 ) to_encode . update ({ \"exp\" : expire }) encoded_jwt = jwt . encode ( to_encode , SECRET_KEY , algorithm = ALGORITHM ) return encoded_jwt async def get_current_user ( security_scopes : SecurityScopes , token : str = Depends ( oauth2_scheme ) ): if security_scopes . scopes : authenticate_value = f 'Bearer scope=\" { security_scopes . scope_str } \"' else : authenticate_value = f \"Bearer\" credentials_exception = HTTPException ( status_code = status .

For this, we import and use Security from fastapi . You can use Security to declare dependencies (just like Depends ), but Security also receives a parameter scopes with a list of scopes (strings). In this case, we pass a dependency function get_current_active_user to Security (the same way we would do with Depends ). But we also pass a list of scopes, in this case with just one scope: items (it could have more). And the dependency function get_current_active_user can also declare sub-dependencies, not only with Depends but also with Security . Declaring its own sub-dependency function ( get_current_user ), and more scope requirements. In this case, it requires the scope me (it could require more than one scope). Note You don't necessarily need to add different scopes in different places. We are doing it here to demonstrate how FastAPI handles scopes declared at different levels. from datetime import datetime , timedelta from typing import List , Union from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI , HTTPException , Security , status from fastapi.security import ( OAuth2PasswordBearer , OAuth2PasswordRequestForm , SecurityScopes , ) from jose import JWTError , jwt from passlib.context import CryptContext from pydantic import BaseModel , ValidationError # to get a string like this run: # openssl rand -hex 32 SECRET_KEY = \"09d25e094faa6ca2556c818166b7a9563b93f7099f6f0f4caa6cf63b88e8d3e7\" ALGORITHM = \"HS256\" ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES = 30 fake_users_db = { \"johndoe\" : { \"username\" : \"johndoe\" , \"full_name\" : \"John Doe\" , \"email\" : \"johndoe@example.com\" , \"hashed_password\" : \"$2b$12$EixZaYVK1fsbw1ZfbX3OXePaWxn96p36WQoeG6Lruj3vjPGga31lW\" , \"disabled\" : False , }, \"alice\" : { \"username\" : \"alice\" , \"full_name\" : \"Alice Chains\" , \"email\" : \"alicechains@example.com\" , \"hashed_password\" : \"$2b$12$gSvqqUPvlXP2tfVFaWK1Be7DlH.PKZbv5H8KnzzVgXXbVxpva.pFm\" , \"disabled\" : True , }, } class Token ( BaseModel ): access_token : str token_type : str class TokenData ( BaseModel ): username : Union [ str , None ] = None scopes : List [ str ] = [] class User ( BaseModel ): username : str email : Union [ str , None ] = None full_name : Union [ str , None ] = None disabled : Union [ bool , None ] = None class UserInDB ( User ): hashed_password : str pwd_context = CryptContext ( schemes = [ \"bcrypt\" ], deprecated = \"auto\" ) oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer ( tokenUrl = \"token\" , scopes = { \"me\" : \"Read information about the current user.\" , \"items\" : \"Read items.\" }, ) app = FastAPI () def verify_password ( plain_password , hashed_password ): return pwd_context . verify ( plain_password , hashed_password ) def get_password_hash ( password ): return pwd_context . hash ( password ) def get_user ( db , username : str ): if username in db : user_dict = db [ username ] return UserInDB ( ** user_dict ) def authenticate_user ( fake_db , username : str , password : str ): user = get_user ( fake_db , username ) if not user : return False if not verify_password ( password , user . hashed_password ): return False return user def create_access_token ( data : dict , expires_delta : Union [ timedelta , None ] = None ): to_encode = data . copy () if expires_delta : expire = datetime . utcnow () + expires_delta else : expire = datetime . utcnow () + timedelta ( minutes = 15 ) to_encode . update ({ \"exp\" : expire }) encoded_jwt = jwt . encode ( to_encode , SECRET_KEY , algorithm = ALGORITHM ) return encoded_jwt async def get_current_user ( security_scopes : SecurityScopes , token : str = Depends ( oauth2_scheme ) ): if security_scopes . scopes : authenticate_value = f 'Bearer scope=\" { security_scopes . scope_str } \"' else : authenticate_value = f \"Bearer\" credentials_exception = HTTPException ( status_code = status .

But by using Security instead of Depends , FastAPI will know that it can declare security scopes, use them internally, and document the API with OpenAPI. But when you import Query , Path , Depends , Security and others from fastapi , those are actually functions that return special classes. Use SecurityScopes \u00b6 Now update the dependency get_current_user . This is the one used by the dependencies above. Here's were we are using the same OAuth2 scheme we created before, declaring it as a dependency: oauth2_scheme . Because this dependency function doesn't have any scope requirements itself, we can use Depends with oauth2_scheme , we don't have to use Security when we don't need to specify security scopes. We also declare a special parameter of type SecurityScopes , imported from fastapi.security . This SecurityScopes class is similar to Request ( Request was used to get the request object directly). from datetime import datetime , timedelta from typing import List , Union from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI , HTTPException , Security , status from fastapi.security import ( OAuth2PasswordBearer , OAuth2PasswordRequestForm , SecurityScopes , ) from jose import JWTError , jwt from passlib.context import CryptContext from pydantic import BaseModel , ValidationError # to get a string like this run: # openssl rand -hex 32 SECRET_KEY = \"09d25e094faa6ca2556c818166b7a9563b93f7099f6f0f4caa6cf63b88e8d3e7\" ALGORITHM = \"HS256\" ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES = 30 fake_users_db = { \"johndoe\" : { \"username\" : \"johndoe\" , \"full_name\" : \"John Doe\" , \"email\" : \"johndoe@example.com\" , \"hashed_password\" : \"$2b$12$EixZaYVK1fsbw1ZfbX3OXePaWxn96p36WQoeG6Lruj3vjPGga31lW\" , \"disabled\" : False , }, \"alice\" : { \"username\" : \"alice\" , \"full_name\" : \"Alice Chains\" , \"email\" : \"alicechains@example.com\" , \"hashed_password\" : \"$2b$12$gSvqqUPvlXP2tfVFaWK1Be7DlH.PKZbv5H8KnzzVgXXbVxpva.pFm\" , \"disabled\" : True , }, } class Token ( BaseModel ): access_token : str token_type : str class TokenData ( BaseModel ): username : Union [ str , None ] = None scopes : List [ str ] = [] class User ( BaseModel ): username : str email : Union [ str , None ] = None full_name : Union [ str , None ] = None disabled : Union [ bool , None ] = None class UserInDB ( User ): hashed_password : str pwd_context = CryptContext ( schemes = [ \"bcrypt\" ], deprecated = \"auto\" ) oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer ( tokenUrl = \"token\" , scopes = { \"me\" : \"Read information about the current user.\" , \"items\" : \"Read items.\" }, ) app = FastAPI () def verify_password ( plain_password , hashed_password ): return pwd_context . verify ( plain_password , hashed_password ) def get_password_hash ( password ): return pwd_context . hash ( password ) def get_user ( db , username : str ): if username in db : user_dict = db [ username ] return UserInDB ( ** user_dict ) def authenticate_user ( fake_db , username : str , password : str ): user = get_user ( fake_db , username ) if not user : return False if not verify_password ( password , user . hashed_password ): return False return user def create_access_token ( data : dict , expires_delta : Union [ timedelta , None ] = None ): to_encode = data . copy () if expires_delta : expire = datetime . utcnow () + expires_delta else : expire = datetime . utcnow () + timedelta ( minutes = 15 ) to_encode . update ({ \"exp\" : expire }) encoded_jwt = jwt . encode ( to_encode , SECRET_KEY , algorithm = ALGORITHM ) return encoded_jwt async def get_current_user ( security_scopes : SecurityScopes , token : str = Depends ( oauth2_scheme ) ): if security_scopes . scopes : authenticate_value = f 'Bearer scope=\" { security_scopes . scope_str } \"' else : authenticate_value = f \"Bearer\" credentials_exception = HTTPException ( status_code = status .

The security_scopes object (of class SecurityScopes ) also provides a scope_str attribute with a single string, containing those scopes separated by spaces (we are going to use it). We create an HTTPException that we can re-use ( raise ) later at several points. In this exception, we include the scopes required (if any) as a string separated by spaces (using scope_str ). We put that string containing the scopes in the WWW-Authenticate header (this is part of the spec). from datetime import datetime , timedelta from typing import List , Union from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI , HTTPException , Security , status from fastapi.security import ( OAuth2PasswordBearer , OAuth2PasswordRequestForm , SecurityScopes , ) from jose import JWTError , jwt from passlib.context import CryptContext from pydantic import BaseModel , ValidationError # to get a string like this run: # openssl rand -hex 32 SECRET_KEY = \"09d25e094faa6ca2556c818166b7a9563b93f7099f6f0f4caa6cf63b88e8d3e7\" ALGORITHM = \"HS256\" ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES = 30 fake_users_db = { \"johndoe\" : { \"username\" : \"johndoe\" , \"full_name\" : \"John Doe\" , \"email\" : \"johndoe@example.com\" , \"hashed_password\" : \"$2b$12$EixZaYVK1fsbw1ZfbX3OXePaWxn96p36WQoeG6Lruj3vjPGga31lW\" , \"disabled\" : False , }, \"alice\" : { \"username\" : \"alice\" , \"full_name\" : \"Alice Chains\" , \"email\" : \"alicechains@example.com\" , \"hashed_password\" : \"$2b$12$gSvqqUPvlXP2tfVFaWK1Be7DlH.PKZbv5H8KnzzVgXXbVxpva.pFm\" , \"disabled\" : True , }, } class Token ( BaseModel ): access_token : str token_type : str class TokenData ( BaseModel ): username : Union [ str , None ] = None scopes : List [ str ] = [] class User ( BaseModel ): username : str email : Union [ str , None ] = None full_name : Union [ str , None ] = None disabled : Union [ bool , None ] = None class UserInDB ( User ): hashed_password : str pwd_context = CryptContext ( schemes = [ \"bcrypt\" ], deprecated = \"auto\" ) oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer ( tokenUrl = \"token\" , scopes = { \"me\" : \"Read information about the current user.\" , \"items\" : \"Read items.\" }, ) app = FastAPI () def verify_password ( plain_password , hashed_password ): return pwd_context . verify ( plain_password , hashed_password ) def get_password_hash ( password ): return pwd_context . hash ( password ) def get_user ( db , username : str ): if username in db : user_dict = db [ username ] return UserInDB ( ** user_dict ) def authenticate_user ( fake_db , username : str , password : str ): user = get_user ( fake_db , username ) if not user : return False if not verify_password ( password , user . hashed_password ): return False return user def create_access_token ( data : dict , expires_delta : Union [ timedelta , None ] = None ): to_encode = data . copy () if expires_delta : expire = datetime . utcnow () + expires_delta else : expire = datetime . utcnow () + timedelta ( minutes = 15 ) to_encode . update ({ \"exp\" : expire }) encoded_jwt = jwt . encode ( to_encode , SECRET_KEY , algorithm = ALGORITHM ) return encoded_jwt async def get_current_user ( security_scopes : SecurityScopes , token : str = Depends ( oauth2_scheme ) ): if security_scopes . scopes : authenticate_value = f 'Bearer scope=\" { security_scopes . scope_str } \"' else : authenticate_value = f \"Bearer\" credentials_exception = HTTPException ( status_code = status .

As the get_current_active_user dependency has as a sub-dependency on get_current_user , the scope \"me\" declared at get_current_active_user will be included in the list of required scopes in the security_scopes.scopes passed to get_current_user . The path operation itself also declares a scope, \"items\" , so this will also be in the list of security_scopes.scopes passed to get_current_user . Here's how the hierarchy of dependencies and scopes looks like: The path operation read_own_items has: Required scopes [\"items\"] with the dependency: get_current_active_user : The dependency function get_current_active_user has: Required scopes [\"me\"] with the dependency: get_current_user : The dependency function get_current_user has: No scopes required by itself. A dependency using oauth2_scheme . A security_scopes parameter of type SecurityScopes : This security_scopes parameter has a property scopes with a list containing all these scopes declared above, so: security_scopes.scopes will contain [\"me\", \"items\"] for the path operation read_own_items . security_scopes.scopes will contain [\"me\"] for the path operation read_users_me , because it is declared in the dependency get_current_active_user . security_scopes.scopes will contain [] (nothing) for the path operation read_system_status , because it didn't declare any Security with scopes , and its dependency, get_current_user , doesn't declare any scope either. Tip The important and \"magic\" thing here is that get_current_user will have a different list of scopes to check for each path operation . All depending on the scopes declared in each path operation and each dependency in the dependency tree for that specific path operation . More details about SecurityScopes \u00b6 You can use SecurityScopes at any point, and in multiple places, it doesn't have to be at the \"root\" dependency. It will always have the security scopes declared in the current Security dependencies and all the dependants for that specific path operation and that specific dependency tree. Because the SecurityScopes will have all the scopes declared by dependants, you can use it to verify that a token has the required scopes in a central dependency function, and then declare different scope requirements in different path operations . They will be checked independently for each path operation . Check it \u00b6 If you open the API docs, you can authenticate and specify which scopes you want to authorize. If you don't select any scope, you will be \"authenticated\", but when you try to access /users/me/ or /users/me/items/ you will get an error saying that you don't have enough permissions. You will still be able to access /status/ . And if you select the scope me but not the scope items , you will be able to access /users/me/ but not /users/me/items/ . That's what would happen to a third party application that tried to access one of these path operations with a token provided by a user, depending on how many permissions the user gave the application. About third party integrations \u00b6 In this example we are using the OAuth2 \"password\" flow. This is appropriate when we are logging in to our own application, probably with our own frontend. Because we can trust it to receive the username and password , as we control it. But if you are building an OAuth2 application that others would connect to (i.e., if you are building an authentication provider equivalent to Facebook, Google, GitHub, etc.) you should use one of the other flows. The most common is the implicit flow. The most secure is the code flow, but is more complex to implement as it requires more steps. As it is more complex, many providers end up suggesting the implicit flow. Note It's common that each authentication provider names their flows in a different way, to make it part of their brand. But in the end, they are implementing the same OAuth2 standard. FastAPI includes utilities for all these OAuth2 authentication flows in fastapi.security.oauth2 . Security in decorator dependencies \u00b6 The same way you can define a list of Depends in the decorator's dependencies parameter (as explained in Dependencies in path operation decorators ), you could also use Security with scopes there.","title":"OAuth2 scopes"},{"location":"advanced/security/oauth2-scopes/#oauth2-scopes","text":"Warning The current page still doesn't have a translation for this language. But you can help translating it: Contributing . You can use OAuth2 scopes directly with FastAPI , they are integrated to work seamlessly. This would allow you to have a more fine-grained permission system, following the OAuth2 standard, integrated into your OpenAPI application (and the API docs). OAuth2 with scopes is the mechanism used by many big authentication providers, like Facebook, Google, GitHub, Microsoft, Twitter, etc. They use it to provide specific permissions to users and applications. Every time you \"log in with\" Facebook, Google, GitHub, Microsoft, Twitter, that application is using OAuth2 with scopes. In this section you will see how to manage authentication and authorization with the same OAuth2 with scopes in your FastAPI application. Warning This is a more or less advanced section. If you are just starting, you can skip it. You don't necessarily need OAuth2 scopes, and you can handle authentication and authorization however you want. But OAuth2 with scopes can be nicely integrated into your API (with OpenAPI) and your API docs. Nevertheless, you still enforce those scopes, or any other security/authorization requirement, however you need, in your code. In many cases, OAuth2 with scopes can be an overkill.

The content of each of these strings can have any format, but should not contain spaces. These scopes represent \"permissions\". In OpenAPI (e.g. the API docs), you can define \"security schemes\". When one of these security schemes uses OAuth2, you can also declare and use scopes. Each \"scope\" is just a string (without spaces). They are normally used to declare specific security permissions, for example: users:read or users:write are common examples. instagram_basic is used by Facebook / Instagram. https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive is used by Google.

We put that string containing the scopes in the WWW-Authenticate header (this is part of the spec). from datetime import datetime , timedelta from typing import List , Union from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI , HTTPException , Security , status from fastapi.security import ( OAuth2PasswordBearer , OAuth2PasswordRequestForm , SecurityScopes , ) from jose import JWTError , jwt from passlib.context import CryptContext from pydantic import BaseModel , ValidationError # to get a string like this run: # openssl rand -hex 32 SECRET_KEY = \"09d25e094faa6ca2556c818166b7a9563b93f7099f6f0f4caa6cf63b88e8d3e7\" ALGORITHM = \"HS256\" ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES = 30 fake_users_db = { \"johndoe\" : { \"username\" : \"johndoe\" , \"full_name\" : \"John Doe\" , \"email\" : \"johndoe@example.com\" , \"hashed_password\" : \"$2b$12$EixZaYVK1fsbw1ZfbX3OXePaWxn96p36WQoeG6Lruj3vjPGga31lW\" , \"disabled\" : False , }, \"alice\" : { \"username\" : \"alice\" , \"full_name\" : \"Alice Chains\" , \"email\" : \"alicechains@example.com\" , \"hashed_password\" : \"$2b$12$gSvqqUPvlXP2tfVFaWK1Be7DlH.PKZbv5H8KnzzVgXXbVxpva.pFm\" , \"disabled\" : True , }, } class Token ( BaseModel ): access_token : str token_type : str class TokenData ( BaseModel ): username : Union [ str , None ] = None scopes : List [ str ] = [] class User ( BaseModel ): username : str email : Union [ str , None ] = None full_name : Union [ str , None ] = None disabled : Union [ bool , None ] = None class UserInDB ( User ): hashed_password : str pwd_context = CryptContext ( schemes = [ \"bcrypt\" ], deprecated = \"auto\" ) oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer ( tokenUrl = \"token\" , scopes = { \"me\" : \"Read information about the current user.\" , \"items\" : \"Read items.\" }, ) app = FastAPI () def verify_password ( plain_password , hashed_password ): return pwd_context . verify ( plain_password , hashed_password ) def get_password_hash ( password ): return pwd_context . hash ( password ) def get_user ( db , username : str ): if username in db : user_dict = db [ username ] return UserInDB ( ** user_dict ) def authenticate_user ( fake_db , username : str , password : str ): user = get_user ( fake_db , username ) if not user : return False if not verify_password ( password , user . hashed_password ): return False return user def create_access_token ( data : dict , expires_delta : Union [ timedelta , None ] = None ): to_encode = data . copy () if expires_delta : expire = datetime . utcnow () + expires_delta else : expire = datetime . utcnow () + timedelta ( minutes = 15 ) to_encode . update ({ \"exp\" : expire }) encoded_jwt = jwt . encode ( to_encode , SECRET_KEY , algorithm = ALGORITHM ) return encoded_jwt async def get_current_user ( security_scopes : SecurityScopes , token : str = Depends ( oauth2_scheme ) ): if security_scopes . scopes : authenticate_value = f 'Bearer scope=\" { security_scopes . scope_str } \"' else : authenticate_value = f \"Bearer\" credentials_exception = HTTPException ( status_code = status .

But you can help translating it: Contributing . When deploying a FastAPI application, or actually, any type of web API, there are several concepts that you probably care about, and using them you can find the most appropriate way to deploy your application . Some of the important concepts are: Security - HTTPS Running on startup Restarts Replication (the number of processes running) Memory Previous steps before starting We'll see how they would affect deployments . In the end, the ultimate objective is to be able to serve your API clients in a way that is secure , to avoid disruptions , and to use the compute resources (for example remote servers/virtual machines) as efficiently as possible. \ud83d\ude80 I'll tell you a bit more about these concepts here, and that would hopefully give you the intuition you would need to decide how to deploy your API in very different environments, possibly even in future ones that don't exist yet. By considering these concepts, you will be able to evaluate and design the best way to deploy your own APIs . In the next chapters, I'll give you more concrete recipes to deploy FastAPI applications. But for now, let's check these important conceptual ideas . These concepts also apply to any other type of web API. \ud83d\udca1 Security - HTTPS \u00b6 In the previous chapter about HTTPS we learned about how HTTPS provides encryption for your API. We also saw that HTTPS is normally provided by a component external to your application server, a TLS Termination Proxy . And there has to be something in charge of renewing the HTTPS certificates , it could be the same component or it could be something different. Example Tools for HTTPS \u00b6 Some of the tools you could use as a TLS Termination Proxy are: Traefik Automatically handles certificates renewals \u2728 Caddy Automatically handles certificates renewals \u2728 Nginx With an external component like Certbot for certificate renewals HAProxy With an external component like Certbot for certificate renewals Kubernetes with an Ingress Controller like Nginx With an external component like cert-manager for certificate renewals Handled internally by a cloud provider as part of their services (read below \ud83d\udc47) Another option is that you could use a cloud service that does more of the work including setting up HTTPS. It could have some restrictions or charge you more, etc. But in that case, you wouldn't have to set up a TLS Termination Proxy yourself. I'll show you some concrete examples in the next chapters. Then the next concepts to consider are all about the program running your actual API (e.g. Uvicorn). Program and Process \u00b6 We will talk a lot about the running \" process \", so it's useful to have clarity about what it means, and what's the difference with the word \" program \". What is a Program \u00b6 The word program is commonly used to describe many things: The code that you write, the Python files . The file that can be executed by the operating system, for example: python , python.exe or uvicorn . A particular program while it is running on the operating system, using the CPU, and storing things on memory. This is also called a process . What is a Process \u00b6 The word process is normally used in a more specific way, only referring to the thing that is running in the operating system (like in the last point above): A particular program while it is running on the operating system. This doesn't refer to the file, nor to the code, it refers specifically to the thing that is being executed and managed by the operating system. Any program, any code, can only do things when it is being executed . So, when there's a process running . The process can be terminated (or \"killed\") by you, or by the operating system. At that point, it stops running/being executed, and it can no longer do things . Each application that you have running on your computer has some process behind it, each running program, each window, etc. And there are normally many processes running at the same time while a computer is on. There can be multiple processes of the same program running at the same time. If you check out the \"task manager\" or \"system monitor\" (or similar tools) in your operating system, you will be able to see many of those processes running. And, for example, you will probably see that there are multiple processes running the same browser program (Firefox, Chrome, Edge, etc). They normally run one process per tab, plus some other extra processes. Now that we know the difference between the terms process and program , let's continue talking about deployments. Running on Startup \u00b6 In most cases, when you create a web API, you want it to be always running , uninterrupted, so that your clients can always access it. This is of course, unless you have a specific reason why you want it to run only in certain situations, but most of the time you want it constantly running and available . In a Remote Server \u00b6 When you set up a remote server (a cloud server, a virtual machine, etc.) the simplest thing you can do is to run Uvicorn (or similar) manually, the same way you do when developing locally. And it will work and will be useful during development . But if your connection to the server is lost, the running process will probably die. And if the server is restarted (for example after updates, or migrations from the cloud provider) you probably won't notice it . And because of that, you won't even know that you have to restart the process manually. So, your API will just stay dead. \ud83d\ude31 Run Automatically on Startup \u00b6 In general, you will probably want the server program (e.g. Uvicorn) to be started automatically on server startup, and without needing any human intervention , to have a process always running with your API (e.g. Uvicorn running your FastAPI app). Separate Program \u00b6 To achieve this, you will normally have a separate program that would make sure your application is run on startup. And in many cases, it would also make sure other components or applications are also run, for example, a database. Example Tools to Run at Startup \u00b6 Some examples of the tools that can do this job are: Docker Kubernetes Docker Compose Docker in Swarm Mode Systemd Supervisor Handled internally by a cloud provider as part of their services Others... I'll give you more concrete examples in the next chapters. Restarts \u00b6 Similar to making sure your application is run on startup, you probably also want to make sure it is restarted after failures. We Make Mistakes \u00b6 We, as humans, make mistakes , all the time. Software almost always has bugs hidden in different places. \ud83d\udc1b And we as developers keep improving the code as we find those bugs and as we implement new features (possibly adding new bugs too \ud83d\ude05). Small Errors Automatically Handled \u00b6 When building web APIs with FastAPI, if there's an error in our code, FastAPI will normally contain it to the single request that triggered the error. \ud83d\udee1 The client will get a 500 Internal Server Error for that request, but the application will continue working for the next requests instead of just crashing completely. Bigger Errors - Crashes \u00b6 Nevertheless, there might be cases where we write some code that crashes the entire application making Uvicorn and Python crash. \ud83d\udca5 And still, you would probably not want the application to stay dead because there was an error in one place, you probably want it to continue running at least for the path operations that are not broken. Restart After Crash \u00b6 But in those cases with really bad errors that crash the running process , you would want an external component that is in charge of restarting the process, at least a couple of times... Tip ...Although if the whole application is just crashing immediately it probably doesn't make sense to keep restarting it forever. But in those cases, you will probably notice it during development, or at least right after deployment. So let's focus on the main cases, where it could crash entirely in some particular cases in the future , and it still makes sense to restart it. You would probably want to have the thing in charge of restarting your application as an external component , because by that point, the same application with Uvicorn and Python already crashed, so there's nothing in the same code of the same app that could do anything about it. Example Tools to Restart Automatically \u00b6 In most cases, the same tool that is used to run the program on startup is also used to handle automatic restarts . For example, this could be handled by: Docker Kubernetes Docker Compose Docker in Swarm Mode Systemd Supervisor Handled internally by a cloud provider as part of their services Others... Replication - Processes and Memory \u00b6 With a FastAPI application, using a server program like Uvicorn, running it once in one process can serve multiple clients concurrently. But in many cases, you will want to run several worker processes at the same time. Multiple Processes - Workers \u00b6 If you have more clients than what a single process can handle (for example if the virtual machine is not too big) and you have multiple cores in the server's CPU, then you could have multiple processes running with the same application at the same time, and distribute all the requests among them. When you run multiple processes of the same API program, they are commonly called workers . Worker Processes and Ports \u00b6 Remember from the docs About HTTPS that only one process can be listening on one combination of port and IP address in a server? This is still true. So, to be able to have multiple processes at the same time, there has to be a single process listening on a port that then transmits the communication to each worker process in some way. Memory per Process \u00b6 Now, when the program loads things in memory, for example, a machine learning model in a variable, or the contents of a large file in a variable, all that consumes a bit of the memory (RAM) of the server. And multiple processes normally don't share any memory . This means that each running process has its own things, variables, and memory. And if you are consuming a large amount of memory in your code, each process will consume an equivalent amount of memory. Server Memory \u00b6 For example, if your code loads a Machine Learning model with 1 GB in size , when you run one process with your API, it will consume at least 1 GB of RAM. And if you start 4 processes (4 workers), each will consume 1 GB of RAM. So in total, your API will consume 4 GB of RAM . And if your remote server or virtual machine only has 3 GB of RAM, trying to load more than 4 GB of RAM will cause problems. \ud83d\udea8 Multiple Processes - An Example \u00b6 In this example, there's a Manager Process that starts and controls two Worker Processes . This Manager Process would probably be the one listening on the port in the IP. And it would transmit all the communication to the worker processes. Those worker processes would be the ones running your application, they would perform the main computations to receive a request and return a response , and they would load anything you put in variables in RAM. And of course, the same machine would probably have other processes running as well, apart from your application. An interesting detail is that the percentage of the CPU used by each process can vary a lot over time, but the memory (RAM) normally stays more or less stable . If you have an API that does a comparable amount of computations every time and you have a lot of clients, then the CPU utilization will probably also be stable (instead of constantly going up and down quickly). Examples of Replication Tools and Strategies \u00b6 There can be several approaches to achieve this, and I'll tell you more about specific strategies in the next chapters, for example when talking about Docker and containers. The main constraint to consider is that there has to be a single component handling the port in the public IP . And then it has to have a way to transmit the communication to the replicated processes/workers . Here are some possible combinations and strategies: Gunicorn managing Uvicorn workers Gunicorn would be the process manager listening on the IP and port , the replication would be by having multiple Uvicorn worker processes Uvicorn managing Uvicorn workers One Uvicorn process manager would listen on the IP and port , and it would start multiple Uvicorn worker processes Kubernetes and other distributed container systems Something in the Kubernetes layer would listen on the IP and port . The replication would be by having multiple containers , each with one Uvicorn process running Cloud services that handle this for your The cloud service will probably handle replication for you . It would possibly let you define a process to run , or a container image to use, in any case, it would most probably be a single Uvicorn process , and the cloud service would be in charge of replicating it. Tip Don't worry if some of these items about containers , Docker, or Kubernetes don't make a lot of sense yet. I'll tell you more about container images, Docker, Kubernetes, etc. in a future chapter: FastAPI in Containers - Docker . Previous Steps Before Starting \u00b6 There are many cases where you want to perform some steps before starting your application. For example, you might want to run database migrations . But in most cases, you will want to perform these steps only once . So, you will want to have a single process to perform those previous steps , before starting the application. And you will have to make sure that it's a single process running those previous steps even if afterwards, you start multiple processes (multiple workers) for the application itself. If those steps were run by multiple processes , they would duplicate the work by running it on parallel , and if the steps were something delicate like a database migration, they could cause conflicts with each other. Of course, there are some cases where there's no problem in running the previous steps multiple times, in that case, it's a lot easier to handle. Tip Also, have in mind that depending on your setup, in some cases you might not even need any previous steps before starting your application. In that case, you wouldn't have to worry about any of this. \ud83e\udd37 Examples of Previous Steps Strategies \u00b6 This will depend heavily on the way you deploy your system , and it would probably be connected to the way you start programs, handling restarts, etc. Here are some possible ideas: An \"Init Container\" in Kubernetes that runs before your app container A bash script that runs the previous steps and then starts your application You would still need a way to start/restart that bash script, detect errors, etc. Tip I'll give you more concrete examples for doing this with containers in a future chapter: FastAPI in Containers - Docker . Resource Utilization \u00b6 Your server(s) is (are) a resource , you can consume or utilize , with your programs, the computation time on the CPUs, and the RAM memory available. How much of the system resources do you want to be consuming/utilizing? It might be easy to think \"not much\", but in reality, you will probably want to consume as much as possible without crashing . If you are paying for 3 servers but you are using only a little bit of their RAM and CPU, you are probably wasting money \ud83d\udcb8, and probably wasting server electric power \ud83c\udf0e, etc. In that case, it could be better to have only 2 servers and use a higher percentage of their resources (CPU, memory, disk, network bandwidth, etc). On the other hand, if you have 2 servers and you are using 100% of their CPU and RAM , at some point one process will ask for more memory, and the server will have to use the disk as \"memory\" (which can be thousands of times slower), or even crash . Or one process might need to do some computation and would have to wait until the CPU is free again. In this case, it would be better to get one extra server and run some processes on it so that they all have enough RAM and CPU time . There's also the chance that for some reason you have a spike of usage of your API. Maybe it went viral, or maybe some other services or bots start using it. And you might want to have extra resources to be safe in those cases. You could put an arbitrary number to target, for example, something between 50% to 90% of resource utilization. The point is that those are probably the main things you will want to measure and use to tweak your deployments. You can use simple tools like htop to see the CPU and RAM used in your server or the amount used by each process. Or you can use more complex monitoring tools, which may be distributed across servers, etc. Recap \u00b6 You have been reading here some of the main concepts that you would probably need to have in mind when deciding how to deploy your application: Security - HTTPS Running on startup Restarts Replication (the number of processes running) Memory Previous steps before starting Understanding these ideas and how to apply them should give you the intuition necessary to take any decisions when configuring and tweaking your deployments. \ud83e\udd13 In the next sections, I'll give you more concrete examples of possible strategies you can follow. \ud83d\ude80","title":"Deployments Concepts"},{"location":"deployment/concepts/#deployments-concepts","text":"Warning The current page still doesn't have a translation for this language.

Some of the important concepts are: Security - HTTPS Running on startup Restarts Replication (the number of processes running) Memory Previous steps before starting We'll see how they would affect deployments . In the end, the ultimate objective is to be able to serve your API clients in a way that is secure , to avoid disruptions , and to use the compute resources (for example remote servers/virtual machines) as efficiently as possible. \ud83d\ude80 I'll tell you a bit more about these concepts here, and that would hopefully give you the intuition you would need to decide how to deploy your API in very different environments, possibly even in future ones that don't exist yet. By considering these concepts, you will be able to evaluate and design the best way to deploy your own APIs . In the next chapters, I'll give you more concrete recipes to deploy FastAPI applications. But for now, let's check these important conceptual ideas . These concepts also apply to any other type of web API. \ud83d\udca1","title":"Deployments Concepts"},{"location":"deployment/concepts/#security-https","text":"In the previous chapter about HTTPS we learned about how HTTPS provides encryption for your API.

It could have some restrictions or charge you more, etc. But in that case, you wouldn't have to set up a TLS Termination Proxy yourself. I'll show you some concrete examples in the next chapters. Then the next concepts to consider are all about the program running your actual API (e.g. Uvicorn).","title":"Example Tools for HTTPS"},{"location":"deployment/concepts/#program-and-process","text":"We will talk a lot about the running \" process \", so it's useful to have clarity about what it means, and what's the difference with the word \" program \".","title":"Program and Process"},{"location":"deployment/concepts/#what-is-a-program","text":"The word program is commonly used to describe many things: The code that you write, the Python files .

This doesn't refer to the file, nor to the code, it refers specifically to the thing that is being executed and managed by the operating system. Any program, any code, can only do things when it is being executed . So, when there's a process running . The process can be terminated (or \"killed\") by you, or by the operating system. At that point, it stops running/being executed, and it can no longer do things . Each application that you have running on your computer has some process behind it, each running program, each window, etc. And there are normally many processes running at the same time while a computer is on. There can be multiple processes of the same program running at the same time. If you check out the \"task manager\" or \"system monitor\" (or similar tools) in your operating system, you will be able to see many of those processes running. And, for example, you will probably see that there are multiple processes running the same browser program (Firefox, Chrome, Edge, etc).

But you can help translating it: Contributing . When deploying FastAPI applications a common approach is to build a Linux container image . It's normally done using Docker . You can then deploy that container image in one of a few possible ways. Using Linux containers has several advantages including security , replicability , simplicity , and others. Tip In a hurry and already know this stuff? Jump to the Dockerfile below \ud83d\udc47 . Dockerfile Preview \ud83d\udc40 FROM python:3.9 WORKDIR /code COPY ./requirements.txt /code/requirements.txt RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r /code/requirements.txt COPY ./app /code/app CMD [ \"uvicorn\" , \"app.main:app\" , \"--host\" , \"0.0.0.0\" , \"--port\" , \"80\" ] # If running behind a proxy like Nginx or Traefik add --proxy-headers # CMD [\"uvicorn\", \"app.main:app\", \"--host\", \"0.0.0.0\", \"--port\", \"80\", \"--proxy-headers\"] What is a Container \u00b6 Containers (mainly Linux containers) are a very lightweight way to package applications including all their dependencies and necessary files while keeping them isolated from other containers (other applications or components) in the same system. Linux containers run using the same Linux kernel of the host (machine, virtual machine, cloud server, etc). This just means that they are very lightweight (compared to full virtual machines emulating an entire operating system). This way, containers consume little resources , an amount comparable to running the processes directly (a virtual machine would consume much more). Containers also have their own isolated running processes (commonly just one process), file system, and network, simplifying deployment, security, development, etc. What is a Container Image \u00b6 A container is run from a container image . A container image is a static version of all the files, environment variables, and the default command/program that should be present in a container. Static here means that the container image is not running, it's not being executed, it's only the packaged files and metadata. In contrast to a \" container image \" that is the stored static contents, a \" container \" normally refers to the running instance, the thing that is being executed . When the container is started and running (started from a container image ) it could create or change files, environment variables, etc. Those changes will exist only in that container, but would not persist in the underlying container image (would not be saved to disk). A container image is comparable to the program file and contents, e.g. python and some file main.py . And the container itself (in contrast to the container image ) is the actual running instance of the image, comparable to a process . In fact, a container is running only when it has a process running (and normally it's only a single process). The container stops when there's no process running in it. Container Images \u00b6 Docker has been one of the main tools to create and manage container images and containers . And there's a public Docker Hub with pre-made official container images for many tools, environments, databases, and applications. For example, there's an official Python Image . And there are many other images for different things like databases, for example for: PostgreSQL MySQL MongoDB Redis , etc. By using a pre-made container image it's very easy to combine and use different tools. For example, to try out a new database. In most cases, you can use the official images , and just configure them with environment variables. That way, in many cases you can learn about containers and Docker and re-use that knowledge with many different tools and components. So, you would run multiple containers with different things, like a database, a Python application, a web server with a React frontend application, and connect them together via their internal network. All the container management systems (like Docker or Kubernetes) have these networking features integrated into them. Containers and Processes \u00b6 A container image normally includes in its metadata the default program or command that should be run when the container is started and the parameters to be passed to that program. Very similar to what would be if it was in the command line. When a container is started, it will run that command/program (although you can override it and make it run a different command/program). A container is running as long as the main process (command or program) is running. A container normally has a single process , but it's also possible to start subprocesses from the main process, and that way you will have multiple processes in the same container. But it's not possible to have a running container without at least one running process . If the main process stops, the container stops. Build a Docker Image for FastAPI \u00b6 Okay, let's build something now! \ud83d\ude80 I'll show you how to build a Docker image for FastAPI from scratch , based on the official Python image. This is what you would want to do in most cases , for example: Using Kubernetes or similar tools When running on a Raspberry Pi Using a cloud service that would run a container image for you, etc. Package Requirements \u00b6 You would normally have the package requirements for your application in some file. It would depend mainly on the tool you use to install those requirements. The most common way to do it is to have a file requirements.txt with the package names and their versions, one per line. You would of course use the same ideas you read in About FastAPI versions to set the ranges of versions. For example, your requirements.txt could look like: fastapi>=0.68.0,<0.69.0 pydantic>=1.8.0,<2.0.0 uvicorn>=0.15.0,<0.16.0 And you would normally install those package dependencies with pip , for example: $ pip install -r requirements.txt ---> 100% Successfully installed fastapi pydantic uvicorn Info There are other formats and tools to define and install package dependencies. I'll show you an example using Poetry later in a section below. \ud83d\udc47 Create the FastAPI Code \u00b6 Create an app directory and enter it. Create an empty file __init__.py . Create a main.py file with: from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/\" ) def read_root (): return { \"Hello\" : \"World\" } @app . get ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) def read_item ( item_id : int , q : Union [ str , None ] = None ): return { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"q\" : q } Dockerfile \u00b6 Now in the same project directory create a file Dockerfile with: # (1) FROM python:3.9 # (2) WORKDIR /code # (3) COPY ./requirements.txt /code/requirements.txt # (4) RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r /code/requirements.txt # (5) COPY ./app /code/app # (6) CMD [ \"uvicorn\" , \"app.main:app\" , \"--host\" , \"0.0.0.0\" , \"--port\" , \"80\" ] Start from the official Python base image. Set the current working directory to /code . This is where we'll put the requirements.txt file and the app directory. Copy the file with the requirements to the /code directory. Copy only the file with the requirements first, not the rest of the code. As this file doesn't change often , Docker will detect it and use the cache for this step, enabling the cache for the next step too. Install the package dependencies in the requirements file. The --no-cache-dir option tells pip to not save the downloaded packages locally, as that is only if pip was going to be run again to install the same packages, but that's not the case when working with containers. Note The --no-cache-dir is only related to pip , it has nothing to do with Docker or containers. The --upgrade option tells pip to upgrade the packages if they are already installed. Because the previous step copying the file could be detected by the Docker cache , this step will also use the Docker cache when available. Using the cache in this step will save you a lot of time when building the image again and again during development, instead of downloading and installing all the dependencies every time . Copy the ./app directory inside the /code directory. As this has all the code which is what changes most frequently the Docker cache won't be used for this or any following steps easily. So, it's important to put this near the end of the Dockerfile , to optimize the container image build times. Set the command to run the uvicorn server. CMD takes a list of strings, each of these strings is what you would type in the command line separated by spaces. This command will be run from the current working directory , the same /code directory you set above with WORKDIR /code . Because the program will be started at /code and inside of it is the directory ./app with your code, Uvicorn will be able to see and import app from app.main . Tip Review what each line does by clicking each number bubble in the code. \ud83d\udc46 You should now have a directory structure like: . \u251c\u2500\u2500 app \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 main.py \u251c\u2500\u2500 Dockerfile \u2514\u2500\u2500 requirements.txt Behind a TLS Termination Proxy \u00b6 If you are running your container behind a TLS Termination Proxy (load balancer) like Nginx or Traefik, add the option --proxy-headers , this will tell Uvicorn to trust the headers sent by that proxy telling it that the application is running behind HTTPS, etc. CMD [ \"uvicorn\" , \"app.main:app\" , \"--proxy-headers\" , \"--host\" , \"0.0.0.0\" , \"--port\" , \"80\" ] Docker Cache \u00b6 There's an important trick in this Dockerfile , we first copy the file with the dependencies alone , not the rest of the code. Let me tell you why is that. COPY ./requirements.txt /code/requirements.txt Docker and other tools build these container images incrementally , adding one layer on top of the other , starting from the top of the Dockerfile and adding any files created by each of the instructions of the Dockerfile . Docker and similar tools also use an internal cache when building the image, if a file hasn't changed since the last time building the container image, then it will re-use the same layer created the last time, instead of copying the file again and creating a new layer from scratch. Just avoiding the copy of files doesn't necessarily improve things too much, but because it used the cache for that step, it can use the cache for the next step . For example, it could use the cache for the instruction that installs dependencies with: RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r /code/requirements.txt The file with the package requirements won't change frequently . So, by copying only that file, Docker will be able to use the cache for that step. And then, Docker will be able to use the cache for the next step that downloads and install those dependencies. And here's where we save a lot of time . \u2728 ...and avoid boredom waiting. \ud83d\ude2a\ud83d\ude06 Downloading and installing the package dependencies could take minutes , but using the cache would take seconds at most. And as you would be building the container image again and again during development to check that your code changes are working, there's a lot of accumulated time this would save. Then, near the end of the Dockerfile , we copy all the code. As this is what changes most frequently , we put it near the end, because almost always, anything after this step will not be able to use the cache. COPY ./app /code/app Build the Docker Image \u00b6 Now that all the files are in place, let's build the container image. Go to the project directory (in where your Dockerfile is, containing your app directory). Build your FastAPI image: $ docker build -t myimage . ---> 100% Tip Notice the . at the end, it's equivalent to ./ , it tells Docker the directory to use to build the container image. In this case, it's the same current directory ( . ). Start the Docker Container \u00b6 Run a container based on your image: $ docker run -d --name mycontainer -p 80 :80 myimage Check it \u00b6 You should be able to check it in your Docker container's URL, for example: http://192.168.99.100/items/5?q=somequery or http://127.0.0.1/items/5?q=somequery (or equivalent, using your Docker host). You will see something like: { \"item_id\" : 5 , \"q\" : \"somequery\" } Interactive API docs \u00b6 Now you can go to http://192.168.99.100/docs or http://127.0.0.1/docs (or equivalent, using your Docker host). You will see the automatic interactive API documentation (provided by Swagger UI ): Alternative API docs \u00b6 And you can also go to http://192.168.99.100/redoc or http://127.0.0.1/redoc (or equivalent, using your Docker host). You will see the alternative automatic documentation (provided by ReDoc ): Build a Docker Image with a Single-File FastAPI \u00b6 If your FastAPI is a single file, for example, main.py without an ./app directory, your file structure could look like this: . \u251c\u2500\u2500 Dockerfile \u251c\u2500\u2500 main.py \u2514\u2500\u2500 requirements.txt Then you would just have to change the corresponding paths to copy the file inside the Dockerfile : FROM python:3.9 WORKDIR /code COPY ./requirements.txt /code/requirements.txt RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r /code/requirements.txt # (1) COPY ./main.py /code/ # (2) CMD [ \"uvicorn\" , \"main:app\" , \"--host\" , \"0.0.0.0\" , \"--port\" , \"80\" ] Copy the main.py file to the /code directory directly (without any ./app directory). Run Uvicorn and tell it to import the app object from main (instead of importing from app.main ). Then adjust the Uvicorn command to use the new module main instead of app.main to import the FastAPI object app . Deployment Concepts \u00b6 Let's talk again about some of the same Deployment Concepts in terms of containers. Containers are mainly a tool to simplify the process of building and deploying an application, but they don't enforce a particular approach to handle these deployment concepts , and there are several possible strategies. The good news is that with each different strategy there's a way to cover all of the deployment concepts. \ud83c\udf89 Let's review these deployment concepts in terms of containers: HTTPS Running on startup Restarts Replication (the number of processes running) Memory Previous steps before starting HTTPS \u00b6 If we focus just on the container image for a FastAPI application (and later the running container ), HTTPS normally would be handled externally by another tool. It could be another container, for example with Traefik , handling HTTPS and automatic acquisition of certificates . Tip Traefik has integrations with Docker, Kubernetes, and others, so it's very easy to set up and configure HTTPS for your containers with it. Alternatively, HTTPS could be handled by a cloud provider as one of their services (while still running the application in a container). Running on Startup and Restarts \u00b6 There is normally another tool in charge of starting and running your container. It could be Docker directly, Docker Compose , Kubernetes , a cloud service , etc. In most (or all) cases, there's a simple option to enable running the container on startup and enabling restarts on failures. For example, in Docker, it's the command line option --restart . Without using containers, making applications run on startup and with restarts can be cumbersome and difficult. But when working with containers in most cases that functionality is included by default. \u2728 Replication - Number of Processes \u00b6 If you have a cluster of machines with Kubernetes , Docker Swarm Mode, Nomad, or another similar complex system to manage distributed containers on multiple machines, then you will probably want to handle replication at the cluster level instead of using a process manager (like Gunicorn with workers) in each container. One of those distributed container management systems like Kubernetes normally has some integrated way of handling replication of containers while still supporting load balancing for the incoming requests. All at the cluster level . In those cases, you would probably want to build a Docker image from scratch as explained above , installing your dependencies, and running a single Uvicorn process instead of running something like Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers. Load Balancer \u00b6 When using containers, you would normally have some component listening on the main port . It could possibly be another container that is also a TLS Termination Proxy to handle HTTPS or some similar tool. As this component would take the load of requests and distribute that among the workers in a (hopefully) balanced way, it is also commonly called a Load Balancer . Tip The same TLS Termination Proxy component used for HTTPS would probably also be a Load Balancer . And when working with containers, the same system you use to start and manage them would already have internal tools to transmit the network communication (e.g. HTTP requests) from that load balancer (that could also be a TLS Termination Proxy ) to the container(s) with your app. One Load Balancer - Multiple Worker Containers \u00b6 When working with Kubernetes or similar distributed container management systems, using their internal networking mechanisms would allow the single load balancer that is listening on the main port to transmit communication (requests) to possibly multiple containers running your app. Each of these containers running your app would normally have just one process (e.g. a Uvicorn process running your FastAPI application). They would all be identical containers , running the same thing, but each with its own process, memory, etc. That way you would take advantage of parallelization in different cores of the CPU, or even in different machines . And the distributed container system with the load balancer would distribute the requests to each one of the containers with your app in turns . So, each request could be handled by one of the multiple replicated containers running your app. And normally this load balancer would be able to handle requests that go to other apps in your cluster (e.g. to a different domain, or under a different URL path prefix), and would transmit that communication to the right containers for that other application running in your cluster. One Process per Container \u00b6 In this type of scenario, you probably would want to have a single (Uvicorn) process per container , as you would already be handling replication at the cluster level. So, in this case, you would not want to have a process manager like Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers, or Uvicorn using its own Uvicorn workers. You would want to have just a single Uvicorn process per container (but probably multiple containers). Having another process manager inside the container (as would be with Gunicorn or Uvicorn managing Uvicorn workers) would only add unnecessary complexity that you are most probably already taking care of with your cluster system. Containers with Multiple Processes and Special Cases \u00b6 Of course, there are special cases where you could want to have a container with a Gunicorn process manager starting several Uvicorn worker processes inside. In those cases, you can use the official Docker image that includes Gunicorn as a process manager running multiple Uvicorn worker processes , and some default settings to adjust the number of workers based on the current CPU cores automatically. I'll tell you more about it below in Official Docker Image with Gunicorn - Uvicorn . Here are some examples of when that could make sense: A Simple App \u00b6 You could want a process manager in the container if your application is simple enough that you don't need (at least not yet) to fine-tune the number of processes too much, and you can just use an automated default (with the official Docker image), and you are running it on a single server , not a cluster. Docker Compose \u00b6 You could be deploying to a single server (not a cluster) with Docker Compose , so you wouldn't have an easy way to manage replication of containers (with Docker Compose) while preserving the shared network and load balancing . Then you could want to have a single container with a process manager starting several worker processes inside. Prometheus and Other Reasons \u00b6 You could also have other reasons that would make it easier to have a single container with multiple processes instead of having multiple containers with a single process in each of them. For example (depending on your setup) you could have some tool like a Prometheus exporter in the same container that should have access to each of the requests that come. In this case, if you had multiple containers , by default, when Prometheus came to read the metrics , it would get the ones for a single container each time (for the container that handled that particular request), instead of getting the accumulated metrics for all the replicated containers. Then, in that case, it could be simpler to have one container with multiple processes , and a local tool (e.g. a Prometheus exporter) on the same container collecting Prometheus metrics for all the internal processes and exposing those metrics on that single container. The main point is, none of these are rules written in stone that you have to blindly follow. You can use these ideas to evaluate your own use case and decide what is the best approach for your system, checking out how to manage the concepts of: Security - HTTPS Running on startup Restarts Replication (the number of processes running) Memory Previous steps before starting Memory \u00b6 If you run a single process per container you will have a more or less well-defined, stable, and limited amount of memory consumed by each of those containers (more than one if they are replicated). And then you can set those same memory limits and requirements in your configurations for your container management system (for example in Kubernetes ). That way it will be able to replicate the containers in the available machines taking into account the amount of memory needed by them, and the amount available in the machines in the cluster. If your application is simple , this will probably not be a problem , and you might not need to specify hard memory limits. But if you are using a lot of memory (for example with machine learning models), you should check how much memory you are consuming and adjust the number of containers that runs in each machine (and maybe add more machines to your cluster). If you run multiple processes per container (for example with the official Docker image) you will have to make sure that the number of processes started doesn't consume more memory than what is available. Previous Steps Before Starting and Containers \u00b6 If you are using containers (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes), then there are two main approaches you can use. Multiple Containers \u00b6 If you have multiple containers , probably each one running a single process (for example, in a Kubernetes cluster), then you would probably want to have a separate container doing the work of the previous steps in a single container, running a single process, before running the replicated worker containers. Info If you are using Kubernetes, this would probably be an Init Container . If in your use case there's no problem in running those previous steps multiple times in parallel (for example if you are not running database migrations, but just checking if the database is ready yet), then you could also just put them in each container right before starting the main process. Single Container \u00b6 If you have a simple setup, with a single container that then starts multiple worker processes (or also just one process), then you could run those previous steps in the same container, right before starting the process with the app. The official Docker image supports this internally. Official Docker Image with Gunicorn - Uvicorn \u00b6 There is an official Docker image that includes Gunicorn running with Uvicorn workers, as detailed in a previous chapter: Server Workers - Gunicorn with Uvicorn . This image would be useful mainly in the situations described above in: Containers with Multiple Processes and Special Cases . tiangolo/uvicorn-gunicorn-fastapi . Warning There's a high chance that you don't need this base image or any other similar one, and would be better off by building the image from scratch as described above in: Build a Docker Image for FastAPI . This image has an auto-tuning mechanism included to set the number of worker processes based on the CPU cores available. It has sensible defaults , but you can still change and update all the configurations with environment variables or configuration files. It also supports running previous steps before starting with a script. Tip To see all the configurations and options, go to the Docker image page: tiangolo/uvicorn-gunicorn-fastapi . Number of Processes on the Official Docker Image \u00b6 The number of processes on this image is computed automatically from the CPU cores available. This means that it will try to squeeze as much performance from the CPU as possible. You can also adjust it with the configurations using environment variables , etc. But it also means that as the number of processes depends on the CPU the container is running, the amount of memory consumed will also depend on that. So, if your application consumes a lot of memory (for example with machine learning models), and your server has a lot of CPU cores but little memory , then your container could end up trying to use more memory than what is available, and degrading performance a lot (or even crashing). \ud83d\udea8 Create a Dockerfile \u00b6 Here's how you would create a Dockerfile based on this image: FROM tiangolo/uvicorn-gunicorn-fastapi:python3.9 COPY ./requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r /app/requirements.txt COPY ./app /app Bigger Applications \u00b6 If you followed the section about creating Bigger Applications with Multiple Files , your Dockerfile might instead look like: FROM tiangolo/uvicorn-gunicorn-fastapi:python3.9 COPY ./requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r /app/requirements.txt COPY ./app /app/app When to Use \u00b6 You should probably not use this official base image (or any other similar one) if you are using Kubernetes (or others) and you are already setting replication at the cluster level, with multiple containers . In those cases, you are better off building an image from scratch as described above: Build a Docker Image for FastAPI . This image would be useful mainly in the special cases described above in Containers with Multiple Processes and Special Cases . For example, if your application is simple enough that setting a default number of processes based on the CPU works well, you don't want to bother with manually configuring the replication at the cluster level, and you are not running more than one container with your app. Or if you are deploying with Docker Compose , running on a single server, etc. Deploy the Container Image \u00b6 After having a Container (Docker) Image there are several ways to deploy it. For example: With Docker Compose in a single server With a Kubernetes cluster With a Docker Swarm Mode cluster With another tool like Nomad With a cloud service that takes your container image and deploys it Docker Image with Poetry \u00b6 If you use Poetry to manage your project's dependencies, you could use Docker multi-stage building: # (1) FROM python:3.9 as requirements-stage # (2) WORKDIR /tmp # (3) RUN pip install poetry # (4) COPY ./pyproject.toml ./poetry.lock* /tmp/ # (5) RUN poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt --without-hashes # (6) FROM python:3.9 # (7) WORKDIR /code # (8) COPY --from = requirements-stage /tmp/requirements.txt /code/requirements.txt # (9) RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r /code/requirements.txt # (10) COPY ./app /code/app # (11) CMD [ \"uvicorn\" , \"app.main:app\" , \"--host\" , \"0.0.0.0\" , \"--port\" , \"80\" ] This is the first stage, it is named requirements-stage . Set /tmp as the current working directory. Here's where we will generate the file requirements.txt Install Poetry in this Docker stage. Copy the pyproject.toml and poetry.lock files to the /tmp directory. Because it uses ./poetry.lock* (ending with a * ), it won't crash if that file is not available yet. Generate the requirements.txt file. This is the final stage, anything here will be preserved in the final container image. Set the current working directory to /code . Copy the requirements.txt file to the /code directory. This file only lives in the previous Docker stage, that's why we use --from-requirements-stage to copy it. Install the package dependencies in the generated requirements.txt file. Copy the app directory to the /code directory. Run the uvicorn command, telling it to use the app object imported from app.main . Tip Click the bubble numbers to see what each line does. A Docker stage is a part of a Dockerfile that works as a temporary container image that is only used to generate some files to be used later. The first stage will only be used to install Poetry and to generate the requirements.txt with your project dependencies from Poetry's pyproject.toml file. This requirements.txt file will be used with pip later in the next stage . In the final container image only the final stage is preserved. The previous stage(s) will be discarded. When using Poetry, it would make sense to use Docker multi-stage builds because you don't really need to have Poetry and its dependencies installed in the final container image, you only need to have the generated requirements.txt file to install your project dependencies. Then in the next (and final) stage you would build the image more or less in the same way as described before. Behind a TLS Termination Proxy - Poetry \u00b6 Again, if you are running your container behind a TLS Termination Proxy (load balancer) like Nginx or Traefik, add the option --proxy-headers to the command: CMD [ \"uvicorn\" , \"app.main:app\" , \"--proxy-headers\" , \"--host\" , \"0.0.0.0\" , \"--port\" , \"80\" ] Recap \u00b6 Using container systems (e.g. with Docker and Kubernetes ) it becomes fairly straightforward to handle all the deployment concepts : HTTPS Running on startup Restarts Replication (the number of processes running) Memory Previous steps before starting In most cases, you probably won't want to use any base image, and instead build a container image from scratch one based on the official Python Docker image. Taking care of the order of instructions in the Dockerfile and the Docker cache you can minimize build times , to maximize your productivity (and avoid boredom). \ud83d\ude0e In certain special cases, you might want to use the official Docker image for FastAPI. \ud83e\udd13","title":"FastAPI in Containers - Docker"},{"location":"deployment/docker/#fastapi-in-containers-docker","text":"Warning The current page still doesn't have a translation for this language.

In contrast to a \" container image \" that is the stored static contents, a \" container \" normally refers to the running instance, the thing that is being executed . When the container is started and running (started from a container image ) it could create or change files, environment variables, etc. Those changes will exist only in that container, but would not persist in the underlying container image (would not be saved to disk). A container image is comparable to the program file and contents, e.g. python and some file main.py . And the container itself (in contrast to the container image ) is the actual running instance of the image, comparable to a process .

For example, to try out a new database. In most cases, you can use the official images , and just configure them with environment variables. That way, in many cases you can learn about containers and Docker and re-use that knowledge with many different tools and components.

The --no-cache-dir option tells pip to not save the downloaded packages locally, as that is only if pip was going to be run again to install the same packages, but that's not the case when working with containers. Note The --no-cache-dir is only related to pip , it has nothing to do with Docker or containers. The --upgrade option tells pip to upgrade the packages if they are already installed.

Docker and similar tools also use an internal cache when building the image, if a file hasn't changed since the last time building the container image, then it will re-use the same layer created the last time, instead of copying the file again and creating a new layer from scratch. Just avoiding the copy of files doesn't necessarily improve things too much, but because it used the cache for that step, it can use the cache for the next step .

But you can help translating it: Contributing . It is easy to assume that HTTPS is something that is just \"enabled\" or not. But it is way more complex than that. Tip If you are in a hurry or don't care, continue with the next sections for step by step instructions to set everything up with different techniques. To learn the basics of HTTPS , from a consumer perspective, check https://howhttps.works/ . Now, from a developer's perspective , here are several things to have in mind while thinking about HTTPS: For HTTPS, the server needs to have \"certificates\" generated by a third party . Those certificates are actually acquired from the third party, not \"generated\". Certificates have a lifetime . They expire . And then they need to be renewed , acquired again from the third party. The encryption of the connection happens at the TCP level . That's one layer below HTTP . So, the certificate and encryption handling is done before HTTP . TCP doesn't know about \"domains\" . Only about IP addresses. The information about the specific domain requested goes in the HTTP data . The HTTPS certificates \"certify\" a certain domain , but the protocol and encryption happen at the TCP level, before knowing which domain is being dealt with. By default , that would mean that you can only have one HTTPS certificate per IP address . No matter how big your server is or how small each application you have on it might be. There is a solution to this, however. There's an extension to the TLS protocol (the one handling the encryption at the TCP level, before HTTP) called SNI . This SNI extension allows one single server (with a single IP address ) to have several HTTPS certificates and serve multiple HTTPS domains/applications . For this to work, a single component (program) running on the server, listening on the public IP address , must have all the HTTPS certificates in the server. After obtaining a secure connection, the communication protocol is still HTTP . The contents are encrypted , even though they are being sent with the HTTP protocol . It is a common practice to have one program/HTTP server running on the server (the machine, host, etc.) and managing all the HTTPS parts : receiving the encrypted HTTPS requests , sending the decrypted HTTP requests to the actual HTTP application running in the same server (the FastAPI application, in this case), take the HTTP response from the application, encrypt it using the appropriate HTTPS certificate and sending it back to the client using HTTPS . This server is often called a TLS Termination Proxy . Some of the options you could use as a TLS Termination Proxy are: Traefik (that can also handle certificate renewals) Caddy (that can also handle certificate renewals) Nginx HAProxy Let's Encrypt \u00b6 Before Let's Encrypt, these HTTPS certificates were sold by trusted third parties. The process to acquire one of these certificates used to be cumbersome, require quite some paperwork and the certificates were quite expensive. But then Let's Encrypt was created. It is a project from the Linux Foundation. It provides HTTPS certificates for free , in an automated way. These certificates use all the standard cryptographic security, and are short-lived (about 3 months), so the security is actually better because of their reduced lifespan. The domains are securely verified and the certificates are generated automatically. This also allows automating the renewal of these certificates. The idea is to automate the acquisition and renewal of these certificates so that you can have secure HTTPS, for free, forever . HTTPS for Developers \u00b6 Here's an example of how an HTTPS API could look like, step by step, paying attention mainly to the ideas important for developers. Domain Name \u00b6 It would probably all start by you acquiring some domain name . Then, you would configure it in a DNS server (possibly your same cloud provider). You would probably get a cloud server (a virtual machine) or something similar, and it would have a fixed public IP address . In the DNS server(s) you would configure a record (an \" A record \") to point your domain to the public IP address of your server . You would probably do this just once, the first time, when setting everything up. Tip This Domain Name part is way before HTTPS, but as everything depends on the domain and the IP address, it's worth mentioning it here. DNS \u00b6 Now let's focus on all the actual HTTPS parts. First, the browser would check with the DNS servers what is the IP for the domain , in this case, someapp.example.com . The DNS servers would tell the browser to use some specific IP address . That would be the public IP address used by your server, that you configured in the DNS servers. TLS Handshake Start \u00b6 The browser would then communicate with that IP address on port 443 (the HTTPS port). The first part of the communication is just to establish the connection between the client and the server and to decide the cryptographic keys they will use, etc. This interaction between the client and the server to establish the TLS connection is called the TLS handshake . TLS with SNI Extension \u00b6 Only one process in the server can be listening on a specific port in a specific IP address . There could be other processes listening on other ports in the same IP address, but only one for each combination of IP address and port. TLS (HTTPS) uses the specific port 443 by default. So that's the port we would need. As only one process can be listening on this port, the process that would do it would be the TLS Termination Proxy . The TLS Termination Proxy would have access to one or more TLS certificates (HTTPS certificates). Using the SNI extension discussed above, the TLS Termination Proxy would check which of the TLS (HTTPS) certificates available it should use for this connection, using the one that matches the domain expected by the client. In this case, it would use the certificate for someapp.example.com . The client already trusts the entity that generated that TLS certificate (in this case Let's Encrypt, but we'll see about that later), so it can verify that the certificate is valid. Then, using the certificate, the client and the TLS Termination Proxy decide how to encrypt the rest of the TCP communication . This completes the TLS Handshake part. After this, the client and the server have an encrypted TCP connection , this is what TLS provides. And then they can use that connection to start the actual HTTP communication . And that's what HTTPS is, it's just plain HTTP inside a secure TLS connection instead of a pure (unencrypted) TCP connection. Tip Notice that the encryption of the communication happens at the TCP level , not at the HTTP level. HTTPS Request \u00b6 Now that the client and server (specifically the browser and the TLS Termination Proxy) have an encrypted TCP connection , they can start the HTTP communication . So, the client sends an HTTPS request . This is just an HTTP request through an encrypted TLS connection. Decrypt the Request \u00b6 The TLS Termination Proxy would use the encryption agreed to decrypt the request , and would transmit the plain (decrypted) HTTP request to the process running the application (for example a process with Uvicorn running the FastAPI application). HTTP Response \u00b6 The application would process the request and send a plain (unencrypted) HTTP response to the TLS Termination Proxy. HTTPS Response \u00b6 The TLS Termination Proxy would then encrypt the response using the cryptography agreed before (that started with the certificate for someapp.example.com ), and send it back to the browser. Next, the browser would verify that the response is valid and encrypted with the right cryptographic key, etc. It would then decrypt the response and process it. The client (browser) will know that the response comes from the correct server because it is using the cryptography they agreed using the HTTPS certificate before. Multiple Applications \u00b6 In the same server (or servers), there could be multiple applications , for example, other API programs or a database. Only one process can be handling the specific IP and port (the TLS Termination Proxy in our example) but the other applications/processes can be running on the server(s) too, as long as they don't try to use the same combination of public IP and port . That way, the TLS Termination Proxy could handle HTTPS and certificates for multiple domains , for multiple applications, and then transmit the requests to the right application in each case. Certificate Renewal \u00b6 At some point in the future, each certificate would expire (about 3 months after acquiring it). And then, there would be another program (in some cases it's another program, in some cases it could be the same TLS Termination Proxy) that would talk to Let's Encrypt, and renew the certificate(s). The TLS certificates are associated with a domain name , not with an IP address. So, to renew the certificates, the renewal program needs to prove to the authority (Let's Encrypt) that it indeed \"owns\" and controls that domain . To do that, and to accommodate different application needs, there are several ways it can do it. Some popular ways are: Modify some DNS records . For this, the renewal program needs to support the APIs of the DNS provider, so, depending on the DNS provider you are using, this might or might not be an option. Run as a server (at least during the certificate acquisition process) on the public IP address associated with the domain. As we said above, only one process can be listening on a specific IP and port. This is one of the reasons why it's very useful when the same TLS Termination Proxy also takes care of the certificate renewal process. Otherwise, you might have to stop the TLS Termination Proxy momentarily, start the renewal program to acquire the certificates, then configure them with the TLS Termination Proxy, and then restart the TLS Termination Proxy. This is not ideal, as your app(s) will not be available during the time that the TLS Termination Proxy is off. All this renewal process, while still serving the app, is one of the main reasons why you would want to have a separate system to handle HTTPS with a TLS Termination Proxy instead of just using the TLS certificates with the application server directly (e.g. Uvicorn). Recap \u00b6 Having HTTPS is very important, and quite critical in most cases. Most of the effort you as a developer have to put around HTTPS is just about understanding these concepts and how they work. But once you know the basic information of HTTPS for developers you can easily combine and configure different tools to help you manage everything in a simple way. In some of the next chapters, I'll show you several concrete examples of how to set up HTTPS for FastAPI applications. \ud83d\udd12","title":"About HTTPS"},{"location":"deployment/https/#about-https","text":"Warning The current page still doesn't have a translation for this language.

But you can help translating it: Contributing . Let's check back those deployment concepts from before: Security - HTTPS Running on startup Restarts Replication (the number of processes running) Memory Previous steps before starting Up to this point, with all the tutorials in the docs, you have probably been running a server program like Uvicorn, running a single process . When deploying applications you will probably want to have some replication of processes to take advantage of multiple cores and to be able to handle more requests. As you saw in the previous chapter about Deployment Concepts , there are multiple strategies you can use. Here I'll show you how to use Gunicorn with Uvicorn worker processes . Info If you are using containers, for example with Docker or Kubernetes, I'll tell you more about that in the next chapter: FastAPI in Containers - Docker . In particular, when running on Kubernetes you will probably not want to use Gunicorn and instead run a single Uvicorn process per container , but I'll tell you about it later in that chapter. Gunicorn with Uvicorn Workers \u00b6 Gunicorn is mainly an application server using the WSGI standard . That means that Gunicorn can serve applications like Flask and Django. Gunicorn by itself is not compatible with FastAPI , as FastAPI uses the newest ASGI standard . But Gunicorn supports working as a process manager and allowing users to tell it which specific worker process class to use. Then Gunicorn would start one or more worker processes using that class. And Uvicorn has a Gunicorn-compatible worker class . Using that combination, Gunicorn would act as a process manager , listening on the port and the IP . And it would transmit the communication to the worker processes running the Uvicorn class . And then the Gunicorn-compatible Uvicorn worker class would be in charge of converting the data sent by Gunicorn to the ASGI standard for FastAPI to use it. Install Gunicorn and Uvicorn \u00b6 $ pip install \"uvicorn[standard]\" gunicorn ---> 100% That will install both Uvicorn with the standard extra packages (to get high performance) and Gunicorn. Run Gunicorn with Uvicorn Workers \u00b6 Then you can run Gunicorn with: $ gunicorn main:app --workers 4 --worker-class uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --bind 0 .0.0.0:80 [19499] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 20.1.0 [19499] [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:80 (19499) [19499] [INFO] Using worker: uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker [19511] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 19511 [19513] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 19513 [19514] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 19514 [19515] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 19515 [19511] [INFO] Started server process [19511] [19511] [INFO] Waiting for application startup.

[19515] [INFO] Started server process [19515] [19515] [INFO] Waiting for application startup. [19515] [INFO] Application startup complete. Let's see what each of those options mean: main:app : This is the same syntax used by Uvicorn, main means the Python module named \" main \", so, a file main.py . And app is the name of the variable that is the FastAPI application. You can imagine that main:app is equivalent to a Python import statement like: from main import app So, the colon in main:app would be equivalent to the Python import part in from main import app . --workers : The number of worker processes to use, each will run a Uvicorn worker, in this case, 4 workers. --worker-class : The Gunicorn-compatible worker class to use in the worker processes. Here we pass the class that Gunicorn can import and use with: import uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --bind : This tells Gunicorn the IP and the port to listen to, using a colon ( : ) to separate the IP and the port. If you were running Uvicorn directly, instead of --bind 0.0.0.0:80 (the Gunicorn option) you would use --host 0.0.0.0 and --port 80 . In the output, you can see that it shows the PID (process ID) of each process (it's just a number). You can see that: The Gunicorn process manager starts with PID 19499 (in your case it will be a different number). Then it starts Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:80 . Then it detects that it has to use the worker class at uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker . And then it starts 4 workers , each with its own PID: 19511 , 19513 , 19514 , and 19515 . Gunicorn would also take care of managing dead processes and restarting new ones if needed to keep the number of workers. So that helps in part with the restart concept from the list above. Nevertheless, you would probably also want to have something outside making sure to restart Gunicorn if necessary, and also to run it on startup , etc. Uvicorn with Workers \u00b6 Uvicorn also has an option to start and run several worker processes . Nevertheless, as of now, Uvicorn's capabilities for handling worker processes are more limited than Gunicorn's. So, if you want to have a process manager at this level (at the Python level), then it might be better to try with Gunicorn as the process manager. In any case, you would run it like this: $ uvicorn main:app --host 0 .0.0.0 --port 8080 --workers 4 <font color=\"#A6E22E\">INFO</font>: Uvicorn running on <b>http://0.0.0.0:8080</b> (Press CTRL+C to quit) <font color=\"#A6E22E\">INFO</font>: Started parent process [<font color=\"#A1EFE4\"><b>27365</b></font>] <font color=\"#A6E22E\">INFO</font>: Started server process [<font color=\"#A1EFE4\">27368</font>] <font color=\"#A6E22E\">INFO</font>: Waiting for application startup. <font color=\"#A6E22E\">INFO</font>: Application startup complete. <font color=\"#A6E22E\">INFO</font>: Started server process [<font color=\"#A1EFE4\">27369</font>] <font color=\"#A6E22E\">INFO</font>: Waiting for application startup. <font color=\"#A6E22E\">INFO</font>: Application startup complete. <font color=\"#A6E22E\">INFO</font>: Started server process [<font color=\"#A1EFE4\">27370</font>] <font color=\"#A6E22E\">INFO</font>: Waiting for application startup. <font color=\"#A6E22E\">INFO</font>: Application startup complete. <font color=\"#A6E22E\">INFO</font>: Started server process [<font color=\"#A1EFE4\">27367</font>] <font color=\"#A6E22E\">INFO</font>: Waiting for application startup. <font color=\"#A6E22E\">INFO</font>: Application startup complete. The only new option here is --workers telling Uvicorn to start 4 worker processes. You can also see that it shows the PID of each process, 27365 for the parent process (this is the process manager ) and one for each worker process: 27368 , 27369 , 27370 , and 27367 . Deployment Concepts \u00b6 Here you saw how to use Gunicorn (or Uvicorn) managing Uvicorn worker processes to parallelize the execution of the application, take advantage of multiple cores in the CPU, and be able to serve more requests . From the list of deployment concepts from above, using workers would mainly help with the replication part, and a little bit with the restarts , but you still need to take care of the others: Security - HTTPS Running on startup Restarts Replication (the number of processes running) Memory Previous steps before starting Containers and Docker \u00b6 In the next chapter about FastAPI in Containers - Docker I'll tell some strategies you could use to handle the other deployment concepts . I'll also show you the official Docker image that includes Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers and some default configurations that can be useful for simple cases. There I'll also show you how to build your own image from scratch to run a single Uvicorn process (without Gunicorn). It is a simple process and is probably what you would want to do when using a distributed container management system like Kubernetes . Recap \u00b6 You can use Gunicorn (or also Uvicorn) as a process manager with Uvicorn workers to take advantage of multi-core CPUs , to run multiple processes in parallel . You could use these tools and ideas if you are setting up your own deployment system while taking care of the other deployment concepts yourself. Check out the next chapter to learn about FastAPI with containers (e.g. Docker and Kubernetes).

But you can help translating it: Contributing . FastAPI is already being used in production in many applications and systems. And the test coverage is kept at 100%. But its development is still moving quickly. New features are added frequently, bugs are fixed regularly, and the code is still continuously improving. That's why the current versions are still 0.x.x , this reflects that each version could potentially have breaking changes. This follows the Semantic Versioning conventions. You can create production applications with FastAPI right now (and you have probably been doing it for some time), you just have to make sure that you use a version that works correctly with the rest of your code. Pin your fastapi version \u00b6 The first thing you should do is to \"pin\" the version of FastAPI you are using to the specific latest version that you know works correctly for your application. For example, let's say you are using version 0.45.0 in your app. If you use a requirements.txt file you could specify the version with: fastapi==0.45.0 that would mean that you would use exactly the version 0.45.0 . Or you could also pin it with: fastapi>=0.45.0,<0.46.0 that would mean that you would use the versions 0.45.0 or above, but less than 0.46.0 , for example, a version 0.45.2 would still be accepted. If you use any other tool to manage your installations, like Poetry, Pipenv, or others, they all have a way that you can use to define specific versions for your packages. Available versions \u00b6 You can see the available versions (e.g. to check what is the current latest) in the Release Notes . About versions \u00b6 Following the Semantic Versioning conventions, any version below 1.0.0 could potentially add breaking changes. FastAPI also follows the convention that any \"PATCH\" version change is for bug fixes and non-breaking changes. Tip The \"PATCH\" is the last number, for example, in 0.2.3 , the PATCH version is 3 . So, you should be able to pin to a version like: fastapi>=0.45.0,<0.46.0 Breaking changes and new features are added in \"MINOR\" versions. Tip The \"MINOR\" is the number in the middle, for example, in 0.2.3 , the MINOR version is 2 . Upgrading the FastAPI versions \u00b6 You should add tests for your app. With FastAPI it's very easy (thanks to Starlette), check the docs: Testing After you have tests, then you can upgrade the FastAPI version to a more recent one, and make sure that all your code is working correctly by running your tests. If everything is working, or after you make the necessary changes, and all your tests are passing, then you can pin your fastapi to that new recent version. About Starlette \u00b6 You shouldn't pin the version of starlette . Different versions of FastAPI will use a specific newer version of Starlette. So, you can just let FastAPI use the correct Starlette version. About Pydantic \u00b6 Pydantic includes the tests for FastAPI with its own tests, so new versions of Pydantic (above 1.0.0 ) are always compatible with FastAPI.

But you can help translating it: Contributing . You can define background tasks to be run after returning a response. This is useful for operations that need to happen after a request, but that the client doesn't really have to be waiting for the operation to complete before receiving the response. This includes, for example: Email notifications sent after performing an action: As connecting to an email server and sending an email tends to be \"slow\" (several seconds), you can return the response right away and send the email notification in the background. Processing data: For example, let's say you receive a file that must go through a slow process, you can return a response of \"Accepted\" (HTTP 202) and process it in the background. Using BackgroundTasks \u00b6 First, import BackgroundTasks and define a parameter in your path operation function with a type declaration of BackgroundTasks : from fastapi import BackgroundTasks , FastAPI app = FastAPI () def write_notification ( email : str , message = \"\" ): with open ( \"log.txt\" , mode = \"w\" ) as email_file : content = f \"notification for { email } : { message } \" email_file . write ( content ) @app . post ( \"/send-notification/ {email} \" ) async def send_notification ( email : str , background_tasks : BackgroundTasks ): background_tasks . add_task ( write_notification , email , message = \"some notification\" ) return { \"message\" : \"Notification sent in the background\" } FastAPI will create the object of type BackgroundTasks for you and pass it as that parameter. Create a task function \u00b6 Create a function to be run as the background task. It is just a standard function that can receive parameters. It can be an async def or normal def function, FastAPI will know how to handle it correctly. In this case, the task function will write to a file (simulating sending an email). And as the write operation doesn't use async and await , we define the function with normal def : from fastapi import BackgroundTasks , FastAPI app = FastAPI () def write_notification ( email : str , message = \"\" ): with open ( \"log.txt\" , mode = \"w\" ) as email_file : content = f \"notification for { email } : { message } \" email_file . write ( content ) @app . post ( \"/send-notification/ {email} \" ) async def send_notification ( email : str , background_tasks : BackgroundTasks ): background_tasks . add_task ( write_notification , email , message = \"some notification\" ) return { \"message\" : \"Notification sent in the background\" } Add the background task \u00b6 Inside of your path operation function , pass your task function to the background tasks object with the method .add_task() : from fastapi import BackgroundTasks , FastAPI app = FastAPI () def write_notification ( email : str , message = \"\" ): with open ( \"log.txt\" , mode = \"w\" ) as email_file : content = f \"notification for { email } : { message } \" email_file . write ( content ) @app . post ( \"/send-notification/ {email} \" ) async def send_notification ( email : str , background_tasks : BackgroundTasks ): background_tasks . add_task ( write_notification , email , message = \"some notification\" ) return { \"message\" : \"Notification sent in the background\" } .add_task() receives as arguments: A task function to be run in the background ( write_notification ). Any sequence of arguments that should be passed to the task function in order ( email ). Any keyword arguments that should be passed to the task function ( message=\"some notification\" ). Dependency Injection \u00b6 Using BackgroundTasks also works with the dependency injection system, you can declare a parameter of type BackgroundTasks at multiple levels: in a path operation function , in a dependency (dependable), in a sub-dependency, etc. FastAPI knows what to do in each case and how to re-use the same object, so that all the background tasks are merged together and are run in the background afterwards: Python 3.6 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Union from fastapi import BackgroundTasks , Depends , FastAPI app = FastAPI () def write_log ( message : str ): with open ( \"log.txt\" , mode = \"a\" ) as log : log . write ( message ) def get_query ( background_tasks : BackgroundTasks , q : Union [ str , None ] = None ): if q : message = f \"found query: { q } \\n \" background_tasks . add_task ( write_log , message ) return q @app . post ( \"/send-notification/ {email} \" ) async def send_notification ( email : str , background_tasks : BackgroundTasks , q : str = Depends ( get_query ) ): message = f \"message to { email } \\n \" background_tasks . add_task ( write_log , message ) return { \"message\" : \"Message sent\" } from fastapi import BackgroundTasks , Depends , FastAPI app = FastAPI () def write_log ( message : str ): with open ( \"log.txt\" , mode = \"a\" ) as log : log . write ( message ) def get_query ( background_tasks : BackgroundTasks , q : str | None = None ): if q : message = f \"found query: { q } \\n \" background_tasks . add_task ( write_log , message ) return q @app . post ( \"/send-notification/ {email} \" ) async def send_notification ( email : str , background_tasks : BackgroundTasks , q : str = Depends ( get_query ) ): message = f \"message to { email } \\n \" background_tasks . add_task ( write_log , message ) return { \"message\" : \"Message sent\" } In this example, the messages will be written to the log.txt file after the response is sent. If there was a query in the request, it will be written to the log in a background task. And then another background task generated at the path operation function will write a message using the email path parameter. Technical Details \u00b6 The class BackgroundTasks comes directly from starlette.background . It is imported/included directly into FastAPI so that you can import it from fastapi and avoid accidentally importing the alternative BackgroundTask (without the s at the end) from starlette.background . By only using BackgroundTasks (and not BackgroundTask ), it's then possible to use it as a path operation function parameter and have FastAPI handle the rest for you, just like when using the Request object directly. It's still possible to use BackgroundTask alone in FastAPI, but you have to create the object in your code and return a Starlette Response including it. You can see more details in Starlette's official docs for Background Tasks . Caveat \u00b6 If you need to perform heavy background computation and you don't necessarily need it to be run by the same process (for example, you don't need to share memory, variables, etc), you might benefit from using other bigger tools like Celery . They tend to require more complex configurations, a message/job queue manager, like RabbitMQ or Redis, but they allow you to run background tasks in multiple processes, and especially, in multiple servers. To see an example, check the Project Generators , they all include Celery already configured. But if you need to access variables and objects from the same FastAPI app, or you need to perform small background tasks (like sending an email notification), you can simply just use BackgroundTasks .

But you can help translating it: Contributing . If you are building an application or a web API, it's rarely the case that you can put everything on a single file. FastAPI provides a convenience tool to structure your application while keeping all the flexibility. Info If you come from Flask, this would be the equivalent of Flask's Blueprints. An example file structure \u00b6 Let's say you have a file structure like this: . \u251c\u2500\u2500 app \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 main.py \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 dependencies.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 routers \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 items.py \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 users.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 internal \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 admin.py Tip There are several __init__.py files: one in each directory or subdirectory. This is what allows importing code from one file into another. For example, in app/main.py you could have a line like: from app.routers import items The app directory contains everything. And it has an empty file app/__init__.py , so it is a \"Python package\" (a collection of \"Python modules\"): app . It contains an app/main.py file. As it is inside a Python package (a directory with a file __init__.py ), it is a \"module\" of that package: app.main . There's also an app/dependencies.py file, just like app/main.py , it is a \"module\": app.dependencies . There's a subdirectory app/routers/ with another file __init__.py , so it's a \"Python subpackage\": app.routers . The file app/routers/items.py is inside a package, app/routers/ , so, it's a submodule: app.routers.items . The same with app/routers/users.py , it's another submodule: app.routers.users . There's also a subdirectory app/internal/ with another file __init__.py , so it's another \"Python subpackage\": app.internal . And the file app/internal/admin.py is another submodule: app.internal.admin . The same file structure with comments: . \u251c\u2500\u2500 app # \"app\" is a Python package \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py # this file makes \"app\" a \"Python package\" \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 main.py # \"main\" module, e.g. import app.main \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 dependencies.py # \"dependencies\" module, e.g. import app.dependencies \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 routers # \"routers\" is a \"Python subpackage\" \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py # makes \"routers\" a \"Python subpackage\" \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 items.py # \"items\" submodule, e.g. import app.routers.items \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 users.py # \"users\" submodule, e.g. import app.routers.users \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 internal # \"internal\" is a \"Python subpackage\" \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py # makes \"internal\" a \"Python subpackage\" \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 admin.py # \"admin\" submodule, e.g. import app.internal.admin APIRouter \u00b6 Let's say the file dedicated to handling just users is the submodule at /app/routers/users.py . You want to have the path operations related to your users separated from the rest of the code, to keep it organized. But it's still part of the same FastAPI application/web API (it's part of the same \"Python Package\"). You can create the path operations for that module using APIRouter . Import APIRouter \u00b6 You import it and create an \"instance\" the same way you would with the class FastAPI : from fastapi import APIRouter router = APIRouter () @router . get ( \"/users/\" , tags = [ \"users\" ]) async def read_users (): return [{ \"username\" : \"Rick\" }, { \"username\" : \"Morty\" }] @router . get ( \"/users/me\" , tags = [ \"users\" ]) async def read_user_me (): return { \"username\" : \"fakecurrentuser\" } @router . get ( \"/users/ {username} \" , tags = [ \"users\" ]) async def read_user ( username : str ): return { \"username\" : username } Path operations with APIRouter \u00b6 And then you use it to declare your path operations . Use it the same way you would use the FastAPI class: from fastapi import APIRouter router = APIRouter () @router . get ( \"/users/\" , tags = [ \"users\" ]) async def read_users (): return [{ \"username\" : \"Rick\" }, { \"username\" : \"Morty\" }] @router . get ( \"/users/me\" , tags = [ \"users\" ]) async def read_user_me (): return { \"username\" : \"fakecurrentuser\" } @router . get ( \"/users/ {username} \" , tags = [ \"users\" ]) async def read_user ( username : str ): return { \"username\" : username } You can think of APIRouter as a \"mini FastAPI \" class. All the same options are supported. All the same parameters , responses , dependencies , tags , etc. Tip In this example, the variable is called router , but you can name it however you want. We are going to include this APIRouter in the main FastAPI app, but first, let's check the dependencies and another APIRouter . Dependencies \u00b6 We see that we are going to need some dependencies used in several places of the application. So we put them in their own dependencies module ( app/dependencies.py ). We will now use a simple dependency to read a custom X-Token header: from fastapi import Header , HTTPException async def get_token_header ( x_token : str = Header ()): if x_token != \"fake-super-secret-token\" : raise HTTPException ( status_code = 400 , detail = \"X-Token header invalid\" ) async def get_query_token ( token : str ): if token != \"jessica\" : raise HTTPException ( status_code = 400 , detail = \"No Jessica token provided\" ) Tip We are using an invented header to simplify this example. But in real cases you will get better results using the integrated Security utilities . Another module with APIRouter \u00b6 Let's say you also have the endpoints dedicated to handling \"items\" from your application in the module at app/routers/items.py . You have path operations for: /items/ /items/{item_id} It's all the same structure as with app/routers/users.py . But we want to be smarter and simplify the code a bit. We know all the path operations in this module have the same: Path prefix : /items . tags : (just one tag: items ). Extra responses . dependencies : they all need that X-Token dependency we created. So, instead of adding all that to each path operation , we can add it to the APIRouter . from fastapi import APIRouter , Depends , HTTPException from ..dependencies import get_token_header router = APIRouter ( prefix = \"/items\" , tags = [ \"items\" ], dependencies = [ Depends ( get_token_header )], responses = { 404 : { \"description\" : \"Not found\" }}, ) fake_items_db = { \"plumbus\" : { \"name\" : \"Plumbus\" }, \"gun\" : { \"name\" : \"Portal Gun\" }} @router . get ( \"/\" ) async def read_items (): return fake_items_db @router . get ( \"/ {item_id} \" ) async def read_item ( item_id : str ): if item_id not in fake_items_db : raise HTTPException ( status_code = 404 , detail = \"Item not found\" ) return { \"name\" : fake_items_db [ item_id ][ \"name\" ], \"item_id\" : item_id } @router . put ( \"/ {item_id} \" , tags = [ \"custom\" ], responses = { 403 : { \"description\" : \"Operation forbidden\" }}, ) async def update_item ( item_id : str ): if item_id != \"plumbus\" : raise HTTPException ( status_code = 403 , detail = \"You can only update the item: plumbus\" ) return { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"name\" : \"The great Plumbus\" } As the path of each path operation has to start with / , like in: @router . get ( \"/ {item_id} \" ) async def read_item ( item_id : str ): ... ...the prefix must not include a final / . So, the prefix in this case is /items . We can also add a list of tags and extra responses that will be applied to all the path operations included in this router. And we can add a list of dependencies that will be added to all the path operations in the router and will be executed/solved for each request made to them. Tip Note that, much like dependencies in path operation decorators , no value will be passed to your path operation function . The end result is that the item paths are now: /items/ /items/{item_id} ...as we intended. They will be marked with a list of tags that contain a single string \"items\" . These \"tags\" are especially useful for the automatic interactive documentation systems (using OpenAPI). All of them will include the predefined responses . All these path operations will have the list of dependencies evaluated/executed before them. If you also declare dependencies in a specific path operation , they will be executed too . The router dependencies are executed first, then the dependencies in the decorator , and then the normal parameter dependencies. You can also add Security dependencies with scopes . Tip Having dependencies in the APIRouter can be used, for example, to require authentication for a whole group of path operations . Even if the dependencies are not added individually to each one of them. Check The prefix , tags , responses , and dependencies parameters are (as in many other cases) just a feature from FastAPI to help you avoid code duplication. Import the dependencies \u00b6 This codes lives in the module app.routers.items , the file app/routers/items.py . And we need to get the dependency function from the module app.dependencies , the file app/dependencies.py . So we use a relative import with .. for the dependencies: from fastapi import APIRouter , Depends , HTTPException from ..dependencies import get_token_header router = APIRouter ( prefix = \"/items\" , tags = [ \"items\" ], dependencies = [ Depends ( get_token_header )], responses = { 404 : { \"description\" : \"Not found\" }}, ) fake_items_db = { \"plumbus\" : { \"name\" : \"Plumbus\" }, \"gun\" : { \"name\" : \"Portal Gun\" }} @router . get ( \"/\" ) async def read_items (): return fake_items_db @router . get ( \"/ {item_id} \" ) async def read_item ( item_id : str ): if item_id not in fake_items_db : raise HTTPException ( status_code = 404 , detail = \"Item not found\" ) return { \"name\" : fake_items_db [ item_id ][ \"name\" ], \"item_id\" : item_id } @router . put ( \"/ {item_id} \" , tags = [ \"custom\" ], responses = { 403 : { \"description\" : \"Operation forbidden\" }}, ) async def update_item ( item_id : str ): if item_id != \"plumbus\" : raise HTTPException ( status_code = 403 , detail = \"You can only update the item: plumbus\" ) return { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"name\" : \"The great Plumbus\" } How relative imports work \u00b6 Tip If you know perfectly how imports work, continue to the next section below. A single dot . , like in: from .dependencies import get_token_header would mean: Starting in the same package that this module (the file app/routers/items.py ) lives in (the directory app/routers/ )... find the module dependencies (an imaginary file at app/routers/dependencies.py )... and from it, import the function get_token_header . But that file doesn't exist, our dependencies are in a file at app/dependencies.py . Remember how our app/file structure looks like: The two dots .. , like in: from ..dependencies import get_token_header mean: Starting in the same package that this module (the file app/routers/items.py ) lives in (the directory app/routers/ )... go to the parent package (the directory app/ )... and in there, find the module dependencies (the file at app/dependencies.py )... and from it, import the function get_token_header . That works correctly! \ud83c\udf89 The same way, if we had used three dots ... , like in: from ...dependencies import get_token_header that would mean: Starting in the same package that this module (the file app/routers/items.py ) lives in (the directory app/routers/ )... go to the parent package (the directory app/ )... then go to the parent of that package (there's no parent package, app is the top level \ud83d\ude31)... and in there, find the module dependencies (the file at app/dependencies.py )... and from it, import the function get_token_header . That would refer to some package above app/ , with its own file __init__.py , etc. But we don't have that. So, that would throw an error in our example. \ud83d\udea8 But now you know how it works, so you can use relative imports in your own apps no matter how complex they are. \ud83e\udd13 Add some custom tags , responses , and dependencies \u00b6 We are not adding the prefix /items nor the tags=[\"items\"] to each path operation because we added them to the APIRouter . But we can still add more tags that will be applied to a specific path operation , and also some extra responses specific to that path operation : from fastapi import APIRouter , Depends , HTTPException from ..dependencies import get_token_header router = APIRouter ( prefix = \"/items\" , tags = [ \"items\" ], dependencies = [ Depends ( get_token_header )], responses = { 404 : { \"description\" : \"Not found\" }}, ) fake_items_db = { \"plumbus\" : { \"name\" : \"Plumbus\" }, \"gun\" : { \"name\" : \"Portal Gun\" }} @router . get ( \"/\" ) async def read_items (): return fake_items_db @router . get ( \"/ {item_id} \" ) async def read_item ( item_id : str ): if item_id not in fake_items_db : raise HTTPException ( status_code = 404 , detail = \"Item not found\" ) return { \"name\" : fake_items_db [ item_id ][ \"name\" ], \"item_id\" : item_id } @router . put ( \"/ {item_id} \" , tags = [ \"custom\" ], responses = { 403 : { \"description\" : \"Operation forbidden\" }}, ) async def update_item ( item_id : str ): if item_id != \"plumbus\" : raise HTTPException ( status_code = 403 , detail = \"You can only update the item: plumbus\" ) return { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"name\" : \"The great Plumbus\" } Tip This last path operation will have the combination of tags: [\"items\", \"custom\"] . And it will also have both responses in the documentation, one for 404 and one for 403 . The main FastAPI \u00b6 Now, let's see the module at app/main.py . Here's where you import and use the class FastAPI . This will be the main file in your application that ties everything together. And as most of your logic will now live in its own specific module, the main file will be quite simple. Import FastAPI \u00b6 You import and create a FastAPI class as normally. And we can even declare global dependencies that will be combined with the dependencies for each APIRouter : from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI from .dependencies import get_query_token , get_token_header from .internal import admin from .routers import items , users app = FastAPI ( dependencies = [ Depends ( get_query_token )]) app . include_router ( users . router ) app . include_router ( items . router ) app . include_router ( admin . router , prefix = \"/admin\" , tags = [ \"admin\" ], dependencies = [ Depends ( get_token_header )], responses = { 418 : { \"description\" : \"I'm a teapot\" }}, ) @app . get ( \"/\" ) async def root (): return { \"message\" : \"Hello Bigger Applications!\" } Import the APIRouter \u00b6 Now we import the other submodules that have APIRouter s: from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI from .dependencies import get_query_token , get_token_header from .internal import admin from .routers import items , users app = FastAPI ( dependencies = [ Depends ( get_query_token )]) app . include_router ( users . router ) app . include_router ( items . router ) app . include_router ( admin . router , prefix = \"/admin\" , tags = [ \"admin\" ], dependencies = [ Depends ( get_token_header )], responses = { 418 : { \"description\" : \"I'm a teapot\" }}, ) @app . get ( \"/\" ) async def root (): return { \"message\" : \"Hello Bigger Applications!\" } As the files app/routers/users.py and app/routers/items.py are submodules that are part of the same Python package app , we can use a single dot . to import them using \"relative imports\". How the importing works \u00b6 The section: from .routers import items , users Means: Starting in the same package that this module (the file app/main.py ) lives in (the directory app/ )... look for the subpackage routers (the directory at app/routers/ )... and from it, import the submodule items (the file at app/routers/items.py ) and users (the file at app/routers/users.py )... The module items will have a variable router ( items.router ). This is the same one we created in the file app/routers/items.py , it's an APIRouter object. And then we do the same for the module users . We could also import them like: from app.routers import items , users Info The first version is a \"relative import\": from .routers import items , users The second version is an \"absolute import\": from app.routers import items , users To learn more about Python Packages and Modules, read the official Python documentation about Modules . Avoid name collisions \u00b6 We are importing the submodule items directly, instead of importing just its variable router . This is because we also have another variable named router in the submodule users . If we had imported one after the other, like: from .routers.items import router from .routers.users import router The router from users would overwrite the one from items and we wouldn't be able to use them at the same time. So, to be able to use both of them in the same file, we import the submodules directly: from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI from .dependencies import get_query_token , get_token_header from .internal import admin from .routers import items , users app = FastAPI ( dependencies = [ Depends ( get_query_token )]) app . include_router ( users . router ) app . include_router ( items . router ) app . include_router ( admin . router , prefix = \"/admin\" , tags = [ \"admin\" ], dependencies = [ Depends ( get_token_header )], responses = { 418 : { \"description\" : \"I'm a teapot\" }}, ) @app . get ( \"/\" ) async def root (): return { \"message\" : \"Hello Bigger Applications!\" } Include the APIRouter s for users and items \u00b6 Now, let's include the router s from the submodules users and items : from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI from .dependencies import get_query_token , get_token_header from .internal import admin from .routers import items , users app = FastAPI ( dependencies = [ Depends ( get_query_token )]) app . include_router ( users . router ) app . include_router ( items . router ) app . include_router ( admin . router , prefix = \"/admin\" , tags = [ \"admin\" ], dependencies = [ Depends ( get_token_header )], responses = { 418 : { \"description\" : \"I'm a teapot\" }}, ) @app . get ( \"/\" ) async def root (): return { \"message\" : \"Hello Bigger Applications!\" } Info users.router contains the APIRouter inside of the file app/routers/users.py . And items.router contains the APIRouter inside of the file app/routers/items.py . With app.include_router() we can add each APIRouter to the main FastAPI application. It will include all the routes from that router as part of it. Technical Details It will actually internally create a path operation for each path operation that was declared in the APIRouter . So, behind the scenes, it will actually work as if everything was the same single app. Check You don't have to worry about performance when including routers. This will take microseconds and will only happen at startup. So it won't affect performance. \u26a1 Include an APIRouter with a custom prefix , tags , responses , and dependencies \u00b6 Now, let's imagine your organization gave you the app/internal/admin.py file. It contains an APIRouter with some admin path operations that your organization shares between several projects. For this example it will be super simple. But let's say that because it is shared with other projects in the organization, we cannot modify it and add a prefix , dependencies , tags , etc. directly to the APIRouter : from fastapi import APIRouter router = APIRouter () @router . post ( \"/\" ) async def update_admin (): return { \"message\" : \"Admin getting schwifty\" } But we still want to set a custom prefix when including the APIRouter so that all its path operations start with /admin , we want to secure it with the dependencies we already have for this project, and we want to include tags and responses . We can declare all that without having to modify the original APIRouter by passing those parameters to app.include_router() : from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI from .dependencies import get_query_token , get_token_header from .internal import admin from .routers import items , users app = FastAPI ( dependencies = [ Depends ( get_query_token )]) app . include_router ( users . router ) app . include_router ( items . router ) app . include_router ( admin . router , prefix = \"/admin\" , tags = [ \"admin\" ], dependencies = [ Depends ( get_token_header )], responses = { 418 : { \"description\" : \"I'm a teapot\" }}, ) @app . get ( \"/\" ) async def root (): return { \"message\" : \"Hello Bigger Applications!\" } That way, the original APIRouter will keep unmodified, so we can still share that same app/internal/admin.py file with other projects in the organization. The result is that in our app, each of the path operations from the admin module will have: The prefix /admin . The tag admin . The dependency get_token_header . The response 418 . \ud83c\udf75 But that will only affect that APIRouter in our app, not in any other code that uses it. So, for example, other projects could use the same APIRouter with a different authentication method. Include a path operation \u00b6 We can also add path operations directly to the FastAPI app. Here we do it... just to show that we can \ud83e\udd37: from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI from .dependencies import get_query_token , get_token_header from .internal import admin from .routers import items , users app = FastAPI ( dependencies = [ Depends ( get_query_token )]) app . include_router ( users . router ) app . include_router ( items . router ) app . include_router ( admin . router , prefix = \"/admin\" , tags = [ \"admin\" ], dependencies = [ Depends ( get_token_header )], responses = { 418 : { \"description\" : \"I'm a teapot\" }}, ) @app . get ( \"/\" ) async def root (): return { \"message\" : \"Hello Bigger Applications!\" } and it will work correctly, together with all the other path operations added with app.include_router() . Very Technical Details Note : this is a very technical detail that you probably can just skip . The APIRouter s are not \"mounted\", they are not isolated from the rest of the application. This is because we want to include their path operations in the OpenAPI schema and the user interfaces. As we cannot just isolate them and \"mount\" them independently of the rest, the path operations are \"cloned\" (re-created), not included directly. Check the automatic API docs \u00b6 Now, run uvicorn , using the module app.main and the variable app : $ uvicorn app.main:app --reload <span style=\"color: green;\">INFO</span>: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit) And open the docs at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs . You will see the automatic API docs, including the paths from all the submodules, using the correct paths (and prefixes) and the correct tags: Include the same router multiple times with different prefix \u00b6 You can also use .include_router() multiple times with the same router using different prefixes. This could be useful, for example, to expose the same API under different prefixes, e.g. /api/v1 and /api/latest . This is an advanced usage that you might not really need, but it's there in case you do. Include an APIRouter in another \u00b6 The same way you can include an APIRouter in a FastAPI application, you can include an APIRouter in another APIRouter using: router . include_router ( other_router ) Make sure you do it before including router in the FastAPI app, so that the path operations from other_router are also included.","title":"Bigger Applications - Multiple Files"},{"location":"tutorial/bigger-applications/#bigger-applications-multiple-files","text":"Warning The current page still doesn't have a translation for this language.

We know all the path operations in this module have the same: Path prefix : /items . tags : (just one tag: items ). Extra responses . dependencies : they all need that X-Token dependency we created.

So, the prefix in this case is /items . We can also add a list of tags and extra responses that will be applied to all the path operations included in this router. And we can add a list of dependencies that will be added to all the path operations in the router and will be executed/solved for each request made to them. Tip Note that, much like dependencies in path operation decorators , no value will be passed to your path operation function . The end result is that the item paths are now: /items/ /items/{item_id} ...as we intended. They will be marked with a list of tags that contain a single string \"items\" . These \"tags\" are especially useful for the automatic interactive documentation systems (using OpenAPI). All of them will include the predefined responses . All these path operations will have the list of dependencies evaluated/executed before them. If you also declare dependencies in a specific path operation , they will be executed too . The router dependencies are executed first, then the dependencies in the decorator , and then the normal parameter dependencies. You can also add Security dependencies with scopes . Tip Having dependencies in the APIRouter can be used, for example, to require authentication for a whole group of path operations .

So, behind the scenes, it will actually work as if everything was the same single app. Check You don't have to worry about performance when including routers. This will take microseconds and will only happen at startup. So it won't affect performance. \u26a1","title":"Include the APIRouters for users and items"},{"location":"tutorial/bigger-applications/#include-an-apirouter-with-a-custom-prefix-tags-responses-and-dependencies","text":"Now, let's imagine your organization gave you the app/internal/admin.py file. It contains an APIRouter with some admin path operations that your organization shares between several projects. For this example it will be super simple. But let's say that because it is shared with other projects in the organization, we cannot modify it and add a prefix , dependencies , tags , etc. directly to the APIRouter : from fastapi import APIRouter router = APIRouter () @router . post ( \"/\" ) async def update_admin (): return { \"message\" : \"Admin getting schwifty\" } But we still want to set a custom prefix when including the APIRouter so that all its path operations start with /admin , we want to secure it with the dependencies we already have for this project, and we want to include tags and responses . We can declare all that without having to modify the original APIRouter by passing those parameters to app.include_router() : from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI from .dependencies import get_query_token , get_token_header from .internal import admin from .routers import items , users app = FastAPI ( dependencies = [ Depends ( get_query_token )]) app . include_router ( users . router ) app . include_router ( items . router ) app . include_router ( admin . router , prefix = \"/admin\" , tags = [ \"admin\" ], dependencies = [ Depends ( get_token_header )], responses = { 418 : { \"description\" : \"I'm a teapot\" }}, ) @app . get ( \"/\" ) async def root (): return { \"message\" : \"Hello Bigger Applications!\" } That way, the original APIRouter will keep unmodified, so we can still share that same app/internal/admin.py file with other projects in the organization. The result is that in our app, each of the path operations from the admin module will have: The prefix /admin . The tag admin . The dependency get_token_header . The response 418 . \ud83c\udf75 But that will only affect that APIRouter in our app, not in any other code that uses it.

But you can help translating it: Contributing . Now that we have seen how to use Path and Query , let's see more advanced uses of request body declarations. Mix Path , Query and body parameters \u00b6 First, of course, you can mix Path , Query and request body parameter declarations freely and FastAPI will know what to do. And you can also declare body parameters as optional, by setting the default to None : Python 3.6 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI , Path from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None price : float tax : Union [ float , None ] = None @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def update_item ( * , item_id : int = Path ( title = \"The ID of the item to get\" , ge = 0 , le = 1000 ), q : Union [ str , None ] = None , item : Union [ Item , None ] = None , ): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id } if q : results . update ({ \"q\" : q }) if item : results . update ({ \"item\" : item }) return results from fastapi import FastAPI , Path from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : str | None = None price : float tax : float | None = None @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def update_item ( * , item_id : int = Path ( title = \"The ID of the item to get\" , ge = 0 , le = 1000 ), q : str | None = None , item : Item | None = None , ): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id } if q : results . update ({ \"q\" : q }) if item : results . update ({ \"item\" : item }) return results Note Notice that, in this case, the item that would be taken from the body is optional. As it has a None default value. Multiple body parameters \u00b6 In the previous example, the path operations would expect a JSON body with the attributes of an Item , like: { \"name\" : \"Foo\" , \"description\" : \"The pretender\" , \"price\" : 42.0 , \"tax\" : 3.2 } But you can also declare multiple body parameters, e.g. item and user : Python 3.6 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None price : float tax : Union [ float , None ] = None class User ( BaseModel ): username : str full_name : Union [ str , None ] = None @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def update_item ( item_id : int , item : Item , user : User ): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"item\" : item , \"user\" : user } return results from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : str | None = None price : float tax : float | None = None class User ( BaseModel ): username : str full_name : str | None = None @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def update_item ( item_id : int , item : Item , user : User ): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"item\" : item , \"user\" : user } return results In this case, FastAPI will notice that there are more than one body parameters in the function (two parameters that are Pydantic models). So, it will then use the parameter names as keys (field names) in the body, and expect a body like: { \"item\" : { \"name\" : \"Foo\" , \"description\" : \"The pretender\" , \"price\" : 42.0 , \"tax\" : 3.2 }, \"user\" : { \"username\" : \"dave\" , \"full_name\" : \"Dave Grohl\" } } Note Notice that even though the item was declared the same way as before, it is now expected to be inside of the body with a key item . FastAPI will do the automatic conversion from the request, so that the parameter item receives it's specific content and the same for user . It will perform the validation of the compound data, and will document it like that for the OpenAPI schema and automatic docs. Singular values in body \u00b6 The same way there is a Query and Path to define extra data for query and path parameters, FastAPI provides an equivalent Body . For example, extending the previous model, you could decide that you want to have another key importance in the same body, besides the item and user . If you declare it as is, because it is a singular value, FastAPI will assume that it is a query parameter. But you can instruct FastAPI to treat it as another body key using Body : Python 3.6 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Union from fastapi import Body , FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None price : float tax : Union [ float , None ] = None class User ( BaseModel ): username : str full_name : Union [ str , None ] = None @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def update_item ( item_id : int , item : Item , user : User , importance : int = Body ()): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"item\" : item , \"user\" : user , \"importance\" : importance } return results from fastapi import Body , FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : str | None = None price : float tax : float | None = None class User ( BaseModel ): username : str full_name : str | None = None @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def update_item ( item_id : int , item : Item , user : User , importance : int = Body ()): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"item\" : item , \"user\" : user , \"importance\" : importance } return results In this case, FastAPI will expect a body like: { \"item\" : { \"name\" : \"Foo\" , \"description\" : \"The pretender\" , \"price\" : 42.0 , \"tax\" : 3.2 }, \"user\" : { \"username\" : \"dave\" , \"full_name\" : \"Dave Grohl\" }, \"importance\" : 5 } Again, it will convert the data types, validate, document, etc. Multiple body params and query \u00b6 Of course, you can also declare additional query parameters whenever you need, additional to any body parameters. As, by default, singular values are interpreted as query parameters, you don't have to explicitly add a Query , you can just do: q : Union [ str , None ] = None Or in Python 3.10 and above: q : str | None = None For example: Python 3.6 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Union from fastapi import Body , FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None price : float tax : Union [ float , None ] = None class User ( BaseModel ): username : str full_name : Union [ str , None ] = None @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def update_item ( * , item_id : int , item : Item , user : User , importance : int = Body ( gt = 0 ), q : Union [ str , None ] = None ): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"item\" : item , \"user\" : user , \"importance\" : importance } if q : results . update ({ \"q\" : q }) return results from fastapi import Body , FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : str | None = None price : float tax : float | None = None class User ( BaseModel ): username : str full_name : str | None = None @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def update_item ( * , item_id : int , item : Item , user : User , importance : int = Body ( gt = 0 ), q : str | None = None ): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"item\" : item , \"user\" : user , \"importance\" : importance } if q : results . update ({ \"q\" : q }) return results Info Body also has all the same extra validation and metadata parameters as Query , Path and others you will see later. Embed a single body parameter \u00b6 Let's say you only have a single item body parameter from a Pydantic model Item . By default, FastAPI will then expect its body directly. But if you want it to expect a JSON with a key item and inside of it the model contents, as it does when you declare extra body parameters, you can use the special Body parameter embed : item : Item = Body ( embed = True ) as in: Python 3.6 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Union from fastapi import Body , FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None price : float tax : Union [ float , None ] = None @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def update_item ( item_id : int , item : Item = Body ( embed = True )): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"item\" : item } return results from fastapi import Body , FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : str | None = None price : float tax : float | None = None @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def update_item ( item_id : int , item : Item = Body ( embed = True )): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"item\" : item } return results In this case FastAPI will expect a body like: { \"item\" : { \"name\" : \"Foo\" , \"description\" : \"The pretender\" , \"price\" : 42.0 , \"tax\" : 3.2 } } instead of: { \"name\" : \"Foo\" , \"description\" : \"The pretender\" , \"price\" : 42.0 , \"tax\" : 3.2 } Recap \u00b6 You can add multiple body parameters to your path operation function , even though a request can only have a single body. But FastAPI will handle it, give you the correct data in your function, and validate and document the correct schema in the path operation . You can also declare singular values to be received as part of the body.

But you can help translating it: Contributing . With FastAPI , you can define, validate, document, and use arbitrarily deeply nested models (thanks to Pydantic). List fields \u00b6 You can define an attribute to be a subtype. For example, a Python list : Python 3.6 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None price : float tax : Union [ float , None ] = None tags : list = [] @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def update_item ( item_id : int , item : Item ): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"item\" : item } return results from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : str | None = None price : float tax : float | None = None tags : list = [] @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def update_item ( item_id : int , item : Item ): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"item\" : item } return results This will make tags be a list of items. Although it doesn't declare the type of each of the items. List fields with type parameter \u00b6 But Python has a specific way to declare lists with internal types, or \"type parameters\": Import typing's List \u00b6 In Python 3.9 and above you can use the standard list to declare these type annotations as we'll see below. \ud83d\udca1 But in Python versions before 3.9 (3.6 and above), you first need to import List from standard Python's typing module: from typing import List , Union from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None price : float tax : Union [ float , None ] = None tags : List [ str ] = [] @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def update_item ( item_id : int , item : Item ): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"item\" : item } return results Declare a list with a type parameter \u00b6 To declare types that have type parameters (internal types), like list , dict , tuple : If you are in a Python version lower than 3.9, import their equivalent version from the typing module Pass the internal type(s) as \"type parameters\" using square brackets: [ and ] In Python 3.9 it would be: my_list : list [ str ] In versions of Python before 3.9, it would be: from typing import List my_list : List [ str ] That's all standard Python syntax for type declarations. Use that same standard syntax for model attributes with internal types. So, in our example, we can make tags be specifically a \"list of strings\": Python 3.6 and above Python 3.9 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import List , Union from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None price : float tax : Union [ float , None ] = None tags : List [ str ] = [] @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def update_item ( item_id : int , item : Item ): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"item\" : item } return results from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None price : float tax : Union [ float , None ] = None tags : list [ str ] = [] @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def update_item ( item_id : int , item : Item ): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"item\" : item } return results from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : str | None = None price : float tax : float | None = None tags : list [ str ] = [] @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def update_item ( item_id : int , item : Item ): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"item\" : item } return results Set types \u00b6 But then we think about it, and realize that tags shouldn't repeat, they would probably be unique strings. And Python has a special data type for sets of unique items, the set . Then we can declare tags as a set of strings: Python 3.6 and above Python 3.9 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Set , Union from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None price : float tax : Union [ float , None ] = None tags : Set [ str ] = set () @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def update_item ( item_id : int , item : Item ): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"item\" : item } return results from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None price : float tax : Union [ float , None ] = None tags : set [ str ] = set () @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def update_item ( item_id : int , item : Item ): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"item\" : item } return results from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : str | None = None price : float tax : float | None = None tags : set [ str ] = set () @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def update_item ( item_id : int , item : Item ): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"item\" : item } return results With this, even if you receive a request with duplicate data, it will be converted to a set of unique items. And whenever you output that data, even if the source had duplicates, it will be output as a set of unique items. And it will be annotated / documented accordingly too. Nested Models \u00b6 Each attribute of a Pydantic model has a type. But that type can itself be another Pydantic model. So, you can declare deeply nested JSON \"objects\" with specific attribute names, types and validations. All that, arbitrarily nested. Define a submodel \u00b6 For example, we can define an Image model: Python 3.6 and above Python 3.9 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Set , Union from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Image ( BaseModel ): url : str name : str class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None price : float tax : Union [ float , None ] = None tags : Set [ str ] = set () image : Union [ Image , None ] = None @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def update_item ( item_id : int , item : Item ): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"item\" : item } return results from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Image ( BaseModel ): url : str name : str class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None price : float tax : Union [ float , None ] = None tags : set [ str ] = set () image : Union [ Image , None ] = None @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def update_item ( item_id : int , item : Item ): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"item\" : item } return results from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Image ( BaseModel ): url : str name : str class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : str | None = None price : float tax : float | None = None tags : set [ str ] = set () image : Image | None = None @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def update_item ( item_id : int , item : Item ): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"item\" : item } return results Use the submodel as a type \u00b6 And then we can use it as the type of an attribute: Python 3.6 and above Python 3.9 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Set , Union from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Image ( BaseModel ): url : str name : str class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None price : float tax : Union [ float , None ] = None tags : Set [ str ] = set () image : Union [ Image , None ] = None @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def update_item ( item_id : int , item : Item ): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"item\" : item } return results from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Image ( BaseModel ): url : str name : str class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None price : float tax : Union [ float , None ] = None tags : set [ str ] = set () image : Union [ Image , None ] = None @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def update_item ( item_id : int , item : Item ): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"item\" : item } return results from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Image ( BaseModel ): url : str name : str class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : str | None = None price : float tax : float | None = None tags : set [ str ] = set () image : Image | None = None @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def update_item ( item_id : int , item : Item ): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"item\" : item } return results This would mean that FastAPI would expect a body similar to: { \"name\" : \"Foo\" , \"description\" : \"The pretender\" , \"price\" : 42.0 , \"tax\" : 3.2 , \"tags\" : [ \"rock\" , \"metal\" , \"bar\" ], \"image\" : { \"url\" : \"http://example.com/baz.jpg\" , \"name\" : \"The Foo live\" } } Again, doing just that declaration, with FastAPI you get: Editor support (completion, etc), even for nested models Data conversion Data validation Automatic documentation Special types and validation \u00b6 Apart from normal singular types like str , int , float , etc. You can use more complex singular types that inherit from str . To see all the options you have, checkout the docs for Pydantic's exotic types . You will see some examples in the next chapter. For example, as in the Image model we have a url field, we can declare it to be instead of a str , a Pydantic's HttpUrl : Python 3.6 and above Python 3.9 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Set , Union from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel , HttpUrl app = FastAPI () class Image ( BaseModel ): url : HttpUrl name : str class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None price : float tax : Union [ float , None ] = None tags : Set [ str ] = set () image : Union [ Image , None ] = None @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def update_item ( item_id : int , item : Item ): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"item\" : item } return results from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel , HttpUrl app = FastAPI () class Image ( BaseModel ): url : HttpUrl name : str class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None price : float tax : Union [ float , None ] = None tags : set [ str ] = set () image : Union [ Image , None ] = None @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def update_item ( item_id : int , item : Item ): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"item\" : item } return results from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel , HttpUrl app = FastAPI () class Image ( BaseModel ): url : HttpUrl name : str class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : str | None = None price : float tax : float | None = None tags : set [ str ] = set () image : Image | None = None @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def update_item ( item_id : int , item : Item ): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"item\" : item } return results The string will be checked to be a valid URL, and documented in JSON Schema / OpenAPI as such. Attributes with lists of submodels \u00b6 You can also use Pydantic models as subtypes of list , set , etc: Python 3.6 and above Python 3.9 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import List , Set , Union from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel , HttpUrl app = FastAPI () class Image ( BaseModel ): url : HttpUrl name : str class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None price : float tax : Union [ float , None ] = None tags : Set [ str ] = set () images : Union [ List [ Image ], None ] = None @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def update_item ( item_id : int , item : Item ): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"item\" : item } return results from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel , HttpUrl app = FastAPI () class Image ( BaseModel ): url : HttpUrl name : str class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None price : float tax : Union [ float , None ] = None tags : set [ str ] = set () images : Union [ list [ Image ], None ] = None @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def update_item ( item_id : int , item : Item ): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"item\" : item } return results from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel , HttpUrl app = FastAPI () class Image ( BaseModel ): url : HttpUrl name : str class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : str | None = None price : float tax : float | None = None tags : set [ str ] = set () images : list [ Image ] | None = None @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def update_item ( item_id : int , item : Item ): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"item\" : item } return results This will expect (convert, validate, document, etc) a JSON body like: { \"name\" : \"Foo\" , \"description\" : \"The pretender\" , \"price\" : 42.0 , \"tax\" : 3.2 , \"tags\" : [ \"rock\" , \"metal\" , \"bar\" ], \"images\" : [ { \"url\" : \"http://example.com/baz.jpg\" , \"name\" : \"The Foo live\" }, { \"url\" : \"http://example.com/dave.jpg\" , \"name\" : \"The Baz\" } ] } Info Notice how the images key now has a list of image objects. Deeply nested models \u00b6 You can define arbitrarily deeply nested models: Python 3.6 and above Python 3.9 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import List , Set , Union from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel , HttpUrl app = FastAPI () class Image ( BaseModel ): url : HttpUrl name : str class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None price : float tax : Union [ float , None ] = None tags : Set [ str ] = set () images : Union [ List [ Image ], None ] = None class Offer ( BaseModel ): name : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None price : float items : List [ Item ] @app . post ( \"/offers/\" ) async def create_offer ( offer : Offer ): return offer from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel , HttpUrl app = FastAPI () class Image ( BaseModel ): url : HttpUrl name : str class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None price : float tax : Union [ float , None ] = None tags : set [ str ] = set () images : Union [ list [ Image ], None ] = None class Offer ( BaseModel ): name : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None price : float items : list [ Item ] @app . post ( \"/offers/\" ) async def create_offer ( offer : Offer ): return offer from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel , HttpUrl app = FastAPI () class Image ( BaseModel ): url : HttpUrl name : str class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : str | None = None price : float tax : float | None = None tags : set [ str ] = set () images : list [ Image ] | None = None class Offer ( BaseModel ): name : str description : str | None = None price : float items : list [ Item ] @app . post ( \"/offers/\" ) async def create_offer ( offer : Offer ): return offer Info Notice how Offer has a list of Item s, which in turn have an optional list of Image s Bodies of pure lists \u00b6 If the top level value of the JSON body you expect is a JSON array (a Python list ), you can declare the type in the parameter of the function, the same as in Pydantic models: images : List [ Image ] or in Python 3.9 and above: images : list [ Image ] as in: Python 3.6 and above Python 3.9 and above from typing import List from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel , HttpUrl app = FastAPI () class Image ( BaseModel ): url : HttpUrl name : str @app . post ( \"/images/multiple/\" ) async def create_multiple_images ( images : List [ Image ]): return images from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel , HttpUrl app = FastAPI () class Image ( BaseModel ): url : HttpUrl name : str @app . post ( \"/images/multiple/\" ) async def create_multiple_images ( images : list [ Image ]): return images Editor support everywhere \u00b6 And you get editor support everywhere. Even for items inside of lists: You couldn't get this kind of editor support if you were working directly with dict instead of Pydantic models. But you don't have to worry about them either, incoming dicts are converted automatically and your output is converted automatically to JSON too. Bodies of arbitrary dict s \u00b6 You can also declare a body as a dict with keys of some type and values of other type. Without having to know beforehand what are the valid field/attribute names (as would be the case with Pydantic models). This would be useful if you want to receive keys that you don't already know. Other useful case is when you want to have keys of other type, e.g. int . That's what we are going to see here. In this case, you would accept any dict as long as it has int keys with float values: Python 3.6 and above Python 3.9 and above from typing import Dict from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI () @app . post ( \"/index-weights/\" ) async def create_index_weights ( weights : Dict [ int , float ]): return weights from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI () @app . post ( \"/index-weights/\" ) async def create_index_weights ( weights : dict [ int , float ]): return weights Tip Have in mind that JSON only supports str as keys. But Pydantic has automatic data conversion. This means that, even though your API clients can only send strings as keys, as long as those strings contain pure integers, Pydantic will convert them and validate them. And the dict you receive as weights will actually have int keys and float values. Recap \u00b6 With FastAPI you have the maximum flexibility provided by Pydantic models, while keeping your code simple, short and elegant. But with all the benefits: Editor support (completion everywhere!)

And the data would be saved with that \"new\" tax of 10.5 . Partial updates with PATCH \u00b6 You can also use the HTTP PATCH operation to partially update data. This means that you can send only the data that you want to update, leaving the rest intact. Note PATCH is less commonly used and known than PUT . And many teams use only PUT , even for partial updates. You are free to use them however you want, FastAPI doesn't impose any restrictions. But this guide shows you, more or less, how they are intended to be used. Using Pydantic's exclude_unset parameter \u00b6 If you want to receive partial updates, it's very useful to use the parameter exclude_unset in Pydantic's model's .dict() . Like item.dict(exclude_unset=True) . That would generate a dict with only the data that was set when creating the item model, excluding default values.

Retrieve the stored data. Put that data in a Pydantic model. Generate a dict without default values from the input model (using exclude_unset ). This way you can update only the values actually set by the user, instead of overriding values already stored with default values in your model. Create a copy of the stored model, updating it's attributes with the received partial updates (using the update parameter). Convert the copied model to something that can be stored in your DB (for example, using the jsonable_encoder ).

But you can help translating it: Contributing . When you need to send data from a client (let's say, a browser) to your API, you send it as a request body . A request body is data sent by the client to your API. A response body is the data your API sends to the client. Your API almost always has to send a response body. But clients don't necessarily need to send request bodies all the time. To declare a request body, you use Pydantic models with all their power and benefits. Info To send data, you should use one of: POST (the more common), PUT , DELETE or PATCH . Sending a body with a GET request has an undefined behavior in the specifications, nevertheless, it is supported by FastAPI, only for very complex/extreme use cases. As it is discouraged, the interactive docs with Swagger UI won't show the documentation for the body when using GET , and proxies in the middle might not support it. Import Pydantic's BaseModel \u00b6 First, you need to import BaseModel from pydantic : Python 3.6 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None price : float tax : Union [ float , None ] = None app = FastAPI () @app . post ( \"/items/\" ) async def create_item ( item : Item ): return item from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : str | None = None price : float tax : float | None = None app = FastAPI () @app . post ( \"/items/\" ) async def create_item ( item : Item ): return item Create your data model \u00b6 Then you declare your data model as a class that inherits from BaseModel . Use standard Python types for all the attributes: Python 3.6 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None price : float tax : Union [ float , None ] = None app = FastAPI () @app . post ( \"/items/\" ) async def create_item ( item : Item ): return item from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : str | None = None price : float tax : float | None = None app = FastAPI () @app . post ( \"/items/\" ) async def create_item ( item : Item ): return item The same as when declaring query parameters, when a model attribute has a default value, it is not required. Otherwise, it is required. Use None to make it just optional. For example, this model above declares a JSON \" object \" (or Python dict ) like: { \"name\" : \"Foo\" , \"description\" : \"An optional description\" , \"price\" : 45.2 , \"tax\" : 3.5 } ...as description and tax are optional (with a default value of None ), this JSON \" object \" would also be valid: { \"name\" : \"Foo\" , \"price\" : 45.2 } Declare it as a parameter \u00b6 To add it to your path operation , declare it the same way you declared path and query parameters: Python 3.6 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None price : float tax : Union [ float , None ] = None app = FastAPI () @app . post ( \"/items/\" ) async def create_item ( item : Item ): return item from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : str | None = None price : float tax : float | None = None app = FastAPI () @app . post ( \"/items/\" ) async def create_item ( item : Item ): return item ...and declare its type as the model you created, Item . Results \u00b6 With just that Python type declaration, FastAPI will: Read the body of the request as JSON. Convert the corresponding types (if needed). Validate the data. If the data is invalid, it will return a nice and clear error, indicating exactly where and what was the incorrect data. Give you the received data in the parameter item . As you declared it in the function to be of type Item , you will also have all the editor support (completion, etc) for all of the attributes and their types. Generate JSON Schema definitions for your model, you can also use them anywhere else you like if it makes sense for your project. Those schemas will be part of the generated OpenAPI schema, and used by the automatic documentation UIs . Automatic docs \u00b6 The JSON Schemas of your models will be part of your OpenAPI generated schema, and will be shown in the interactive API docs: And will be also used in the API docs inside each path operation that needs them: Editor support \u00b6 In your editor, inside your function you will get type hints and completion everywhere (this wouldn't happen if you received a dict instead of a Pydantic model): You also get error checks for incorrect type operations: This is not by chance, the whole framework was built around that design. And it was thoroughly tested at the design phase, before any implementation, to ensure it would work with all the editors. There were even some changes to Pydantic itself to support this. The previous screenshots were taken with Visual Studio Code . But you would get the same editor support with PyCharm and most of the other Python editors: Tip If you use PyCharm as your editor, you can use the Pydantic PyCharm Plugin .

CORS or \"Cross-Origin Resource Sharing\" refers to the situations when a frontend running in a browser has JavaScript code that communicates with a backend, and the backend is in a different \"origin\" than the frontend. Origin \u00b6 An origin is the combination of protocol ( http , https ), domain ( myapp.com , localhost , localhost.tiangolo.com ), and port ( 80 , 443 , 8080 ). So, all these are different origins: http://localhost https://localhost http://localhost:8080 Even if they are all in localhost , they use different protocols or ports, so, they are different \"origins\". Steps \u00b6 So, let's say you have a frontend running in your browser at http://localhost:8080 , and its JavaScript is trying to communicate with a backend running at http://localhost (because we don't specify a port, the browser will assume the default port 80 ). Then, the browser will send an HTTP OPTIONS request to the backend, and if the backend sends the appropriate headers authorizing the communication from this different origin ( http://localhost:8080 ) then the browser will let the JavaScript in the frontend send its request to the backend. To achieve this, the backend must have a list of \"allowed origins\". In this case, it would have to include http://localhost:8080 for the frontend to work correctly. Wildcards \u00b6 It's also possible to declare the list as \"*\" (a \"wildcard\") to say that all are allowed. But that will only allow certain types of communication, excluding everything that involves credentials: Cookies, Authorization headers like those used with Bearer Tokens, etc. So, for everything to work correctly, it's better to specify explicitly the allowed origins.

The following arguments are supported: allow_origins - A list of origins that should be permitted to make cross-origin requests. E.g. ['https://example.org', 'https://www.example.org'] . You can use ['*'] to allow any origin. allow_origin_regex - A regex string to match against origins that should be permitted to make cross-origin requests. e.g. 'https://.*\\.example\\.org' . allow_methods - A list of HTTP methods that should be allowed for cross-origin requests.

But you can help translating it: Contributing . Continuing with the previous example, it will be common to have more than one related model.

Pydantic models have a .dict() method that returns a dict with the model's data. So, if we create a Pydantic object user_in like: user_in = UserIn ( username = \"john\" , password = \"secret\" , email = \"john.doe@example.com\" ) and then we call: user_dict = user_in . dict () we now have a dict with the data in the variable user_dict (it's a dict instead of a Pydantic model object). And if we call: print ( user_dict ) we would get a Python dict with: { 'username' : 'john' , 'password' : 'secret' , 'email' : 'john.doe@example.com' , 'full_name' : None , } Unwrapping a dict \u00b6 If we take a dict like user_dict and pass it to a function (or class) with **user_dict , Python will \"unwrap\" it. It will pass the keys and values of the user_dict directly as key-value arguments. So, continuing with the user_dict from above, writing: UserInDB ( ** user_dict ) Would result in something equivalent to: UserInDB ( username = \"john\" , password = \"secret\" , email = \"john.doe@example.com\" , full_name = None , ) Or more exactly, using user_dict directly, with whatever contents it might have in the future: UserInDB ( username = user_dict [ \"username\" ], password = user_dict [ \"password\" ], email = user_dict [ \"email\" ], full_name = user_dict [ \"full_name\" ], ) A Pydantic model from the contents of another \u00b6 As in the example above we got user_dict from user_in.dict() , this code: user_dict = user_in . dict () UserInDB ( ** user_dict ) would be equivalent to: UserInDB ( ** user_in . dict ()) ...because user_in.dict() is a dict , and then we make Python \"unwrap\" it by passing it to UserInDB prepended with ** . So, we get a Pydantic model from the data in another Pydantic model. Unwrapping a dict and extra keywords \u00b6 And then adding the extra keyword argument hashed_password=hashed_password , like in: UserInDB ( ** user_in . dict (), hashed_password = hashed_password ) ...ends up being like: UserInDB ( username = user_dict [ \"username\" ], password = user_dict [ \"password\" ], email = user_dict [ \"email\" ], full_name = user_dict [ \"full_name\" ], hashed_password = hashed_password , ) Warning The supporting additional functions are just to demo a possible flow of the data, but they of course are not providing any real security. Reduce duplication \u00b6 Reducing code duplication is one of the core ideas in FastAPI . As code duplication increments the chances of bugs, security issues, code desynchronization issues (when you update in one place but not in the others), etc. And these models are all sharing a lot of the data and duplicating attribute names and types. We could do better. We can declare a UserBase model that serves as a base for our other models. And then we can make subclasses of that model that inherit its attributes (type declarations, validation, etc). All the data conversion, validation, documentation, etc. will still work as normally. That way, we can declare just the differences between the models (with plaintext password , with hashed_password and without password): Python 3.6 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel , EmailStr app = FastAPI () class UserBase ( BaseModel ): username : str email : EmailStr full_name : Union [ str , None ] = None class UserIn ( UserBase ): password : str class UserOut ( UserBase ): pass class UserInDB ( UserBase ): hashed_password : str def fake_password_hasher ( raw_password : str ): return \"supersecret\" + raw_password def fake_save_user ( user_in : UserIn ): hashed_password = fake_password_hasher ( user_in . password ) user_in_db = UserInDB ( ** user_in . dict (), hashed_password = hashed_password ) print ( \"User saved! ..not really\" ) return user_in_db @app . post ( \"/user/\" , response_model = UserOut ) async def create_user ( user_in : UserIn ): user_saved = fake_save_user ( user_in ) return user_saved from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel , EmailStr app = FastAPI () class UserBase ( BaseModel ): username : str email : EmailStr full_name : str | None = None class UserIn ( UserBase ): password : str class UserOut ( UserBase ): pass class UserInDB ( UserBase ): hashed_password : str def fake_password_hasher ( raw_password : str ): return \"supersecret\" + raw_password def fake_save_user ( user_in : UserIn ): hashed_password = fake_password_hasher ( user_in . password ) user_in_db = UserInDB ( ** user_in . dict (), hashed_password = hashed_password ) print ( \"User saved! ..not really\" ) return user_in_db @app . post ( \"/user/\" , response_model = UserOut ) async def create_user ( user_in : UserIn ): user_saved = fake_save_user ( user_in ) return user_saved Union or anyOf \u00b6 You can declare a response to be the Union of two types, that means, that the response would be any of the two. It will be defined in OpenAPI with anyOf . To do that, use the standard Python type hint typing.Union : Note When defining a Union , include the most specific type first, followed by the less specific type. In the example below, the more specific PlaneItem comes before CarItem in Union[PlaneItem, CarItem] . Python 3.6 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class BaseItem ( BaseModel ): description : str type : str class CarItem ( BaseItem ): type = \"car\" class PlaneItem ( BaseItem ): type = \"plane\" size : int items = { \"item1\" : { \"description\" : \"All my friends drive a low rider\" , \"type\" : \"car\" }, \"item2\" : { \"description\" : \"Music is my aeroplane, it's my aeroplane\" , \"type\" : \"plane\" , \"size\" : 5 , }, } @app . get ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" , response_model = Union [ PlaneItem , CarItem ]) async def read_item ( item_id : str ): return items [ item_id ] from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class BaseItem ( BaseModel ): description : str type : str class CarItem ( BaseItem ): type = \"car\" class PlaneItem ( BaseItem ): type = \"plane\" size : int items = { \"item1\" : { \"description\" : \"All my friends drive a low rider\" , \"type\" : \"car\" }, \"item2\" : { \"description\" : \"Music is my aeroplane, it's my aeroplane\" , \"type\" : \"plane\" , \"size\" : 5 , }, } @app . get ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" , response_model = Union [ PlaneItem , CarItem ]) async def read_item ( item_id : str ): return items [ item_id ] Union in Python 3.10 \u00b6 In this example we pass Union[PlaneItem, CarItem] as the value of the argument response_model . Because we are passing it as a value to an argument instead of putting it in a type annotation , we have to use Union even in Python 3.10. If it was in a type annotation we could have used the vertical bar, as: some_variable : PlaneItem | CarItem But if we put that in response_model=PlaneItem | CarItem we would get an error, because Python would try to perform an invalid operation between PlaneItem and CarItem instead of interpreting that as a type annotation. List of models \u00b6 The same way, you can declare responses of lists of objects. For that, use the standard Python typing.List (or just list in Python 3.9 and above): Python 3.6 and above Python 3.9 and above from typing import List from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : str items = [ { \"name\" : \"Foo\" , \"description\" : \"There comes my hero\" }, { \"name\" : \"Red\" , \"description\" : \"It's my aeroplane\" }, ] @app . get ( \"/items/\" , response_model = List [ Item ]) async def read_items (): return items from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str description : str items = [ { \"name\" : \"Foo\" , \"description\" : \"There comes my hero\" }, { \"name\" : \"Red\" , \"description\" : \"It's my aeroplane\" }, ] @app . get ( \"/items/\" , response_model = list [ Item ]) async def read_items (): return items Response with arbitrary dict \u00b6 You can also declare a response using a plain arbitrary dict , declaring just the type of the keys and values, without using a Pydantic model. This is useful if you don't know the valid field/attribute names (that would be needed for a Pydantic model) beforehand. In this case, you can use typing.Dict (or just dict in Python 3.9 and above): Python 3.6 and above Python 3.9 and above from typing import Dict from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/keyword-weights/\" , response_model = Dict [ str , float ]) async def read_keyword_weights (): return { \"foo\" : 2.3 , \"bar\" : 3.4 } from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/keyword-weights/\" , response_model = dict [ str , float ]) async def read_keyword_weights (): return { \"foo\" : 2.3 , \"bar\" : 3.4 } Recap \u00b6 Use multiple Pydantic models and inherit freely for each case. You don't need to have a single data model per entity if that entity must be able to have different \"states\".

You will see the alternative automatic documentation (provided by ReDoc ): OpenAPI \u00b6 FastAPI generates a \"schema\" with all your API using the OpenAPI standard for defining APIs. \"Schema\" \u00b6 A \"schema\" is a definition or description of something. Not the code that implements it, but just an abstract description. API \"schema\" \u00b6 In this case, OpenAPI is a specification that dictates how to define a schema of your API. This schema definition includes your API paths, the possible parameters they take, etc. Data \"schema\" \u00b6 The term \"schema\" might also refer to the shape of some data, like a JSON content. In that case, it would mean the JSON attributes, and data types they have, etc. OpenAPI and JSON Schema \u00b6 OpenAPI defines an API schema for your API. And that schema includes definitions (or \"schemas\") of the data sent and received by your API using JSON Schema , the standard for JSON data schemas. Check the openapi.json \u00b6 If you are curious about how the raw OpenAPI schema looks like, FastAPI automatically generates a JSON (schema) with the descriptions of all your API. You can see it directly at: http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json . It will show a JSON starting with something like: { \"openapi\" : \"3.0.2\" , \"info\" : { \"title\" : \"FastAPI\" , \"version\" : \"0.1.0\" }, \"paths\" : { \"/items/\" : { \"get\" : { \"responses\" : { \"200\" : { \"description\" : \"Successful Response\" , \"content\" : { \"application/json\" : { ... What is OpenAPI for \u00b6 The OpenAPI schema is what powers the two interactive documentation systems included. And there are dozens of alternatives, all based on OpenAPI. You could easily add any of those alternatives to your application built with FastAPI . You could also use it to generate code automatically, for clients that communicate with your API. For example, frontend, mobile or IoT applications. Recap, step by step \u00b6 Step 1: import FastAPI \u00b6 from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/\" ) async def root (): return { \"message\" : \"Hello World\" } FastAPI is a Python class that provides all the functionality for your API. Technical Details FastAPI is a class that inherits directly from Starlette . You can use all the Starlette functionality with FastAPI too. Step 2: create a FastAPI \"instance\" \u00b6 from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/\" ) async def root (): return { \"message\" : \"Hello World\" } Here the app variable will be an \"instance\" of the class FastAPI . This will be the main point of interaction to create all your API. This app is the same one referred by uvicorn in the command: $ uvicorn main:app --reload <span style=\"color: green;\">INFO</span>: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit) If you create your app like: from fastapi import FastAPI my_awesome_api = FastAPI () @my_awesome_api . get ( \"/\" ) async def root (): return { \"message\" : \"Hello World\" } And put it in a file main.py , then you would call uvicorn like: $ uvicorn main:my_awesome_api --reload <span style=\"color: green;\">INFO</span>: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit) Step 3: create a path operation \u00b6 Path \u00b6 \"Path\" here refers to the last part of the URL starting from the first / . So, in a URL like: https://example.com/items/foo ...the path would be: /items/foo Info A \"path\" is also commonly called an \"endpoint\" or a \"route\". While building an API, the \"path\" is the main way to separate \"concerns\" and \"resources\". Operation \u00b6 \"Operation\" here refers to one of the HTTP \"methods\". One of: POST GET PUT DELETE ...and the more exotic ones: OPTIONS HEAD PATCH TRACE In the HTTP protocol, you can communicate to each path using one (or more) of these \"methods\". When building APIs, you normally use these specific HTTP methods to perform a specific action. Normally you use: POST : to create data. GET : to read data. PUT : to update data. DELETE : to delete data. So, in OpenAPI, each of the HTTP methods is called an \"operation\". We are going to call them \" operations \" too. Define a path operation decorator \u00b6 from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/\" ) async def root (): return { \"message\" : \"Hello World\" } The @app.get(\"/\") tells FastAPI that the function right below is in charge of handling requests that go to: the path / using a get operation @decorator Info That @something syntax in Python is called a \"decorator\". You put it on top of a function. Like a pretty decorative hat (I guess that's where the term came from). A \"decorator\" takes the function below and does something with it. In our case, this decorator tells FastAPI that the function below corresponds to the path / with an operation get . It is the \" path operation decorator \". You can also use the other operations: @app.post() @app.put() @app.delete() And the more exotic ones: @app.options() @app.head() @app.patch() @app.trace() Tip You are free to use each operation (HTTP method) as you wish. FastAPI doesn't enforce any specific meaning. The information here is presented as a guideline, not a requirement. For example, when using GraphQL you normally perform all the actions using only POST operations. Step 4: define the path operation function \u00b6 This is our \" path operation function \": path : is / . operation : is get . function : is the function below the \"decorator\" (below @app.get(\"/\") ). from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/\" ) async def root (): return { \"message\" : \"Hello World\" } This is a Python function. It will be called by FastAPI whenever it receives a request to the URL \" / \" using a GET operation. In this case, it is an async function. You could also define it as a normal function instead of async def : from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/\" ) def root (): return { \"message\" : \"Hello World\" } Note If you don't know the difference, check the Async: \"In a hurry?\" . Step 5: return the content \u00b6 from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/\" ) async def root (): return { \"message\" : \"Hello World\" } You can return a dict , list , singular values as str , int , etc. You can also return Pydantic models (you'll see more about that later). There are many other objects and models that will be automatically converted to JSON (including ORMs, etc). Try using your favorite ones, it's highly probable that they are already supported. Recap \u00b6 Import FastAPI . Create an app instance. Write a path operation decorator (like @app.get(\"/\") ). Write a path operation function (like def root(): ... above).

But you can help translating it: Contributing . There are many situations in where you need to notify an error to a client that is using your API. This client could be a browser with a frontend, a code from someone else, an IoT device, etc. You could need to tell the client that: The client doesn't have enough privileges for that operation. The client doesn't have access to that resource. The item the client was trying to access doesn't exist. etc. In these cases, you would normally return an HTTP status code in the range of 400 (from 400 to 499). This is similar to the 200 HTTP status codes (from 200 to 299). Those \"200\" status codes mean that somehow there was a \"success\" in the request. The status codes in the 400 range mean that there was an error from the client. Remember all those \"404 Not Found\" errors (and jokes)? Use HTTPException \u00b6 To return HTTP responses with errors to the client you use HTTPException . Import HTTPException \u00b6 from fastapi import FastAPI , HTTPException app = FastAPI () items = { \"foo\" : \"The Foo Wrestlers\" } @app . get ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def read_item ( item_id : str ): if item_id not in items : raise HTTPException ( status_code = 404 , detail = \"Item not found\" ) return { \"item\" : items [ item_id ]} Raise an HTTPException in your code \u00b6 HTTPException is a normal Python exception with additional data relevant for APIs. Because it's a Python exception, you don't return it, you raise it. This also means that if you are inside a utility function that you are calling inside of your path operation function , and you raise the HTTPException from inside of that utility function, it won't run the rest of the code in the path operation function , it will terminate that request right away and send the HTTP error from the HTTPException to the client. The benefit of raising an exception over return ing a value will be more evident in the section about Dependencies and Security. In this example, when the client requests an item by an ID that doesn't exist, raise an exception with a status code of 404 : from fastapi import FastAPI , HTTPException app = FastAPI () items = { \"foo\" : \"The Foo Wrestlers\" } @app . get ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def read_item ( item_id : str ): if item_id not in items : raise HTTPException ( status_code = 404 , detail = \"Item not found\" ) return { \"item\" : items [ item_id ]} The resulting response \u00b6 If the client requests http://example.com/items/foo (an item_id \"foo\" ), that client will receive an HTTP status code of 200, and a JSON response of: { \"item\" : \"The Foo Wrestlers\" } But if the client requests http://example.com/items/bar (a non-existent item_id \"bar\" ), that client will receive an HTTP status code of 404 (the \"not found\" error), and a JSON response of: { \"detail\" : \"Item not found\" } Tip When raising an HTTPException , you can pass any value that can be converted to JSON as the parameter detail , not only str . You could pass a dict , a list , etc. They are handled automatically by FastAPI and converted to JSON. Add custom headers \u00b6 There are some situations in where it's useful to be able to add custom headers to the HTTP error. For example, for some types of security. You probably won't need to use it directly in your code. But in case you needed it for an advanced scenario, you can add custom headers: from fastapi import FastAPI , HTTPException app = FastAPI () items = { \"foo\" : \"The Foo Wrestlers\" } @app . get ( \"/items-header/ {item_id} \" ) async def read_item_header ( item_id : str ): if item_id not in items : raise HTTPException ( status_code = 404 , detail = \"Item not found\" , headers = { \"X-Error\" : \"There goes my error\" }, ) return { \"item\" : items [ item_id ]} Install custom exception handlers \u00b6 You can add custom exception handlers with the same exception utilities from Starlette . Let's say you have a custom exception UnicornException that you (or a library you use) might raise . And you want to handle this exception globally with FastAPI. You could add a custom exception handler with @app.exception_handler() : from fastapi import FastAPI , Request from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse class UnicornException ( Exception ): def __init__ ( self , name : str ): self . name = name app = FastAPI () @app . exception_handler ( UnicornException ) async def unicorn_exception_handler ( request : Request , exc : UnicornException ): return JSONResponse ( status_code = 418 , content = { \"message\" : f \"Oops! { exc . name } did something. There goes a rainbow...\" }, ) @app . get ( \"/unicorns/ {name} \" ) async def read_unicorn ( name : str ): if name == \"yolo\" : raise UnicornException ( name = name ) return { \"unicorn_name\" : name } Here, if you request /unicorns/yolo , the path operation will raise a UnicornException . But it will be handled by the unicorn_exception_handler . So, you will receive a clean error, with an HTTP status code of 418 and a JSON content of: { \"message\" : \"Oops! yolo did something. There goes a rainbow...\" } Technical Details You could also use from starlette.requests import Request and from starlette.responses import JSONResponse . FastAPI provides the same starlette.responses as fastapi.responses just as a convenience for you, the developer. But most of the available responses come directly from Starlette. The same with Request . Override the default exception handlers \u00b6 FastAPI has some default exception handlers. These handlers are in charge of returning the default JSON responses when you raise an HTTPException and when the request has invalid data. You can override these exception handlers with your own. Override request validation exceptions \u00b6 When a request contains invalid data, FastAPI internally raises a RequestValidationError . And it also includes a default exception handler for it. To override it, import the RequestValidationError and use it with @app.exception_handler(RequestValidationError) to decorate the exception handler. The exception handler will receive a Request and the exception. from fastapi import FastAPI , HTTPException from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError from fastapi.responses import PlainTextResponse from starlette.exceptions import HTTPException as StarletteHTTPException app = FastAPI () @app . exception_handler ( StarletteHTTPException ) async def http_exception_handler ( request , exc ): return PlainTextResponse ( str ( exc . detail ), status_code = exc . status_code ) @app . exception_handler ( RequestValidationError ) async def validation_exception_handler ( request , exc ): return PlainTextResponse ( str ( exc ), status_code = 400 ) @app . get ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def read_item ( item_id : int ): if item_id == 3 : raise HTTPException ( status_code = 418 , detail = \"Nope! I don't like 3.\" ) return { \"item_id\" : item_id } Now, if you go to /items/foo , instead of getting the default JSON error with: { \"detail\" : [ { \"loc\" : [ \"path\" , \"item_id\" ], \"msg\" : \"value is not a valid integer\" , \"type\" : \"type_error.integer\" } ] } you will get a text version, with: 1 validation error path -> item_id value is not a valid integer (type=type_error.integer) RequestValidationError vs ValidationError \u00b6 Warning These are technical details that you might skip if it's not important for you now. RequestValidationError is a sub-class of Pydantic's ValidationError . FastAPI uses it so that, if you use a Pydantic model in response_model , and your data has an error, you will see the error in your log. But the client/user will not see it. Instead, the client will receive an \"Internal Server Error\" with a HTTP status code 500 . It should be this way because if you have a Pydantic ValidationError in your response or anywhere in your code (not in the client's request ), it's actually a bug in your code. And while you fix it, your clients/users shouldn't have access to internal information about the error, as that could expose a security vulnerability. Override the HTTPException error handler \u00b6 The same way, you can override the HTTPException handler. For example, you could want to return a plain text response instead of JSON for these errors: from fastapi import FastAPI , HTTPException from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError from fastapi.responses import PlainTextResponse from starlette.exceptions import HTTPException as StarletteHTTPException app = FastAPI () @app . exception_handler ( StarletteHTTPException ) async def http_exception_handler ( request , exc ): return PlainTextResponse ( str ( exc . detail ), status_code = exc . status_code ) @app . exception_handler ( RequestValidationError ) async def validation_exception_handler ( request , exc ): return PlainTextResponse ( str ( exc ), status_code = 400 ) @app . get ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def read_item ( item_id : int ): if item_id == 3 : raise HTTPException ( status_code = 418 , detail = \"Nope! I don't like 3.\" ) return { \"item_id\" : item_id } Technical Details You could also use from starlette.responses import PlainTextResponse . FastAPI provides the same starlette.responses as fastapi.responses just as a convenience for you, the developer. But most of the available responses come directly from Starlette. Use the RequestValidationError body \u00b6 The RequestValidationError contains the body it received with invalid data. You could use it while developing your app to log the body and debug it, return it to the user, etc. from fastapi import FastAPI , Request , status from fastapi.encoders import jsonable_encoder from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () @app . exception_handler ( RequestValidationError ) async def validation_exception_handler ( request : Request , exc : RequestValidationError ): return JSONResponse ( status_code = status . HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY , content = jsonable_encoder ({ \"detail\" : exc . errors (), \"body\" : exc . body }), ) class Item ( BaseModel ): title : str size : int @app . post ( \"/items/\" ) async def create_item ( item : Item ): return item Now try sending an invalid item like: { \"title\" : \"towel\" , \"size\" : \"XL\" } You will receive a response telling you that the data is invalid containing the received body: { \"detail\" : [ { \"loc\" : [ \"body\" , \"size\" ], \"msg\" : \"value is not a valid integer\" , \"type\" : \"type_error.integer\" } ], \"body\" : { \"title\" : \"towel\" , \"size\" : \"XL\" } } FastAPI's HTTPException vs Starlette's HTTPException \u00b6 FastAPI has its own HTTPException . And FastAPI 's HTTPException error class inherits from Starlette's HTTPException error class. The only difference, is that FastAPI 's HTTPException allows you to add headers to be included in the response. This is needed/used internally for OAuth 2.0 and some security utilities. So, you can keep raising FastAPI 's HTTPException as normally in your code. But when you register an exception handler, you should register it for Starlette's HTTPException . This way, if any part of Starlette's internal code, or a Starlette extension or plug-in, raises a Starlette HTTPException , your handler will be able to catch and handle it. In this example, to be able to have both HTTPException s in the same code, Starlette's exceptions is renamed to StarletteHTTPException : from starlette.exceptions import HTTPException as StarletteHTTPException Re-use FastAPI 's exception handlers \u00b6 If you want to use the exception along with the same default exception handlers from FastAPI , You can import and re-use the default exception handlers from fastapi.exception_handlers : from fastapi import FastAPI , HTTPException from fastapi.exception_handlers import ( http_exception_handler , request_validation_exception_handler , ) from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError from starlette.exceptions import HTTPException as StarletteHTTPException app = FastAPI () @app . exception_handler ( StarletteHTTPException ) async def custom_http_exception_handler ( request , exc ): print ( f \"OMG!

It also inherits from the same common Param class. But remember that when you import Query , Path , Header , and others from fastapi , those are actually functions that return special classes. Info To declare headers, you need to use Header , because otherwise the parameters would be interpreted as query parameters. Automatic conversion \u00b6 Header has a little extra functionality on top of what Path , Query and Cookie provide. Most of the standard headers are separated by a \"hyphen\" character, also known as the \"minus symbol\" ( - ). But a variable like user-agent is invalid in Python. So, by default, Header will convert the parameter names characters from underscore ( _ ) to hyphen ( - ) to extract and document the headers. Also, HTTP headers are case-insensitive, so, you can declare them with standard Python style (also known as \"snake_case\"). So, you can use user_agent as you normally would in Python code, instead of needing to capitalize the first letters as User_Agent or something similar. If for some reason you need to disable automatic conversion of underscores to hyphens, set the parameter convert_underscores of Header to False : Python 3.6 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI , Header app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( strange_header : Union [ str , None ] = Header ( default = None , convert_underscores = False ) ): return { \"strange_header\" : strange_header } from fastapi import FastAPI , Header app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( strange_header : str | None = Header ( default = None , convert_underscores = False ) ): return { \"strange_header\" : strange_header } Warning Before setting convert_underscores to False , bear in mind that some HTTP proxies and servers disallow the usage of headers with underscores. Duplicate headers \u00b6 It is possible to receive duplicate headers. That means, the same header with multiple values. You can define those cases using a list in the type declaration. You will receive all the values from the duplicate header as a Python list . For example, to declare a header of X-Token that can appear more than once, you can write: Python 3.6 and above Python 3.9 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import List , Union from fastapi import FastAPI , Header app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( x_token : Union [ List [ str ], None ] = Header ( default = None )): return { \"X-Token values\" : x_token } from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI , Header app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( x_token : Union [ list [ str ], None ] = Header ( default = None )): return { \"X-Token values\" : x_token } from fastapi import FastAPI , Header app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( x_token : list [ str ] | None = Header ( default = None )): return { \"X-Token values\" : x_token } If you communicate with that path operation sending two HTTP headers like: X-Token: foo X-Token: bar The response would be like: { \"X-Token values\" : [ \"bar\" , \"foo\" ] } Recap \u00b6 Declare headers with Header , using the same common pattern as Query , Path and Cookie .

Most of the standard headers are separated by a \"hyphen\" character, also known as the \"minus symbol\" ( - ). But a variable like user-agent is invalid in Python. So, by default, Header will convert the parameter names characters from underscore ( _ ) to hyphen ( - ) to extract and document the headers. Also, HTTP headers are case-insensitive, so, you can declare them with standard Python style (also known as \"snake_case\"). So, you can use user_agent as you normally would in Python code, instead of needing to capitalize the first letters as User_Agent or something similar.

For example, to declare a title metadata value for the path parameter item_id you can type: Python 3.6 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI , Path , Query app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def read_items ( item_id : int = Path ( title = \"The ID of the item to get\" ), q : Union [ str , None ] = Query ( default = None , alias = \"item-query\" ), ): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id } if q : results . update ({ \"q\" : q }) return results from fastapi import FastAPI , Path , Query app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def read_items ( item_id : int = Path ( title = \"The ID of the item to get\" ), q : str | None = Query ( default = None , alias = \"item-query\" ), ): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id } if q : results . update ({ \"q\" : q }) return results Note A path parameter is always required as it has to be part of the path. So, you should declare it with ... to mark it as required. Nevertheless, even if you declared it with None or set a default value, it would not affect anything, it would still be always required. Order the parameters as you need \u00b6 Let's say that you want to declare the query parameter q as a required str . And you don't need to declare anything else for that parameter, so you don't really need to use Query . But you still need to use Path for the item_id path parameter. Python will complain if you put a value with a \"default\" before a value that doesn't have a \"default\". But you can re-order them, and have the value without a default (the query parameter q ) first. It doesn't matter for FastAPI . It will detect the parameters by their names, types and default declarations ( Query , Path , etc), it doesn't care about the order. So, you can declare your function as: from fastapi import FastAPI , Path app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def read_items ( q : str , item_id : int = Path ( title = \"The ID of the item to get\" )): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id } if q : results . update ({ \"q\" : q }) return results Order the parameters as you need, tricks \u00b6 If you want to declare the q query parameter without a Query nor any default value, and the path parameter item_id using Path , and have them in a different order, Python has a little special syntax for that. Pass * , as the first parameter of the function. Python won't do anything with that * , but it will know that all the following parameters should be called as keyword arguments (key-value pairs), also known as kwargs . Even if they don't have a default value. from fastapi import FastAPI , Path app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def read_items ( * , item_id : int = Path ( title = \"The ID of the item to get\" ), q : str ): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id } if q : results . update ({ \"q\" : q }) return results Number validations: greater than or equal \u00b6 With Query and Path (and other's you'll see later) you can declare string constraints, but also number constraints. Here, with ge=1 , item_id will need to be an integer number \" g reater than or e qual\" to 1 . from fastapi import FastAPI , Path app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def read_items ( * , item_id : int = Path ( title = \"The ID of the item to get\" , ge = 1 ), q : str ): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id } if q : results . update ({ \"q\" : q }) return results Number validations: greater than and less than or equal \u00b6 The same applies for: gt : g reater t han le : l ess than or e qual from fastapi import FastAPI , Path app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def read_items ( * , item_id : int = Path ( title = \"The ID of the item to get\" , gt = 0 , le = 1000 ), q : str , ): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id } if q : results . update ({ \"q\" : q }) return results Number validations: floats, greater than and less than \u00b6 Number validations also work for float values. Here's where it becomes important to be able to declare gt and not just ge . As with it you can require, for example, that a value must be greater than 0 , even if it is less than 1 . So, 0.5 would be a valid value. But 0.0 or 0 would not. And the same for lt . from fastapi import FastAPI , Path , Query app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def read_items ( * , item_id : int = Path ( title = \"The ID of the item to get\" , ge = 0 , le = 1000 ), q : str , size : float = Query ( gt = 0 , lt = 10.5 ) ): results = { \"item_id\" : item_id } if q : results . update ({ \"q\" : q }) return results Recap \u00b6 With Query , Path (and others you haven't seen yet) you can declare metadata and string validations in the same ways as with Query Parameters and String Validations . And you can also declare numeric validations: gt : g reater t han ge : g reater than or e qual lt : l ess t han le : l ess than or e qual Info Query , Path , and others you will see later are subclasses of a common Param class (that you don't need to use). And all of them share the same all these same parameters of additional validation and metadata you have seen. Technical Details When you import Query , Path and others from fastapi , they are actually functions. That when called, return instances of classes of the same name. So, you import Query , which is a function. And when you call it, it returns an instance of a class also named Query . These functions are there (instead of just using the classes directly) so that your editor doesn't mark errors about their types.

So, if you run this example and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/foo , you will see a response of: { \"item_id\" : \"foo\" } Path parameters with types \u00b6 You can declare the type of a path parameter in the function, using standard Python type annotations: from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def read_item ( item_id : int ): return { \"item_id\" : item_id } In this case, item_id is declared to be an int . Check This will give you editor support inside of your function, with error checks, completion, etc. Data conversion \u00b6 If you run this example and open your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/3 , you will see a response of: { \"item_id\" : 3 } Check Notice that the value your function received (and returned) is 3 , as a Python int , not a string \"3\" . So, with that type declaration, FastAPI gives you automatic request \"parsing\" . Data validation \u00b6 But if you go to the browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/foo , you will see a nice HTTP error of: { \"detail\" : [ { \"loc\" : [ \"path\" , \"item_id\" ], \"msg\" : \"value is not a valid integer\" , \"type\" : \"type_error.integer\" } ] } because the path parameter item_id had a value of \"foo\" , which is not an int .

Notice that the path parameter is declared to be an integer. Standards-based benefits, alternative documentation \u00b6 And because the generated schema is from the OpenAPI standard, there are many compatible tools. Because of this, FastAPI itself provides an alternative API documentation (using ReDoc), which you can access at http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc : The same way, there are many compatible tools. Including code generation tools for many languages. Pydantic \u00b6 All the data validation is performed under the hood by Pydantic , so you get all the benefits from it. And you know you are in good hands. You can use the same type declarations with str , float , bool and many other complex data types. Several of these are explored in the next chapters of the tutorial. Order matters \u00b6 When creating path operations , you can find situations where you have a fixed path. Like /users/me , let's say that it's to get data about the current user. And then you can also have a path /users/{user_id} to get data about a specific user by some user ID. Because path operations are evaluated in order, you need to make sure that the path for /users/me is declared before the one for /users/{user_id} : from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/users/me\" ) async def read_user_me (): return { \"user_id\" : \"the current user\" } @app . get ( \"/users/ {user_id} \" ) async def read_user ( user_id : str ): return { \"user_id\" : user_id } Otherwise, the path for /users/{user_id} would match also for /users/me , \"thinking\" that it's receiving a parameter user_id with a value of \"me\" . Similarly, you cannot redefine a path operation: from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/users\" ) async def read_users (): return [ \"Rick\" , \"Morty\" ] @app . get ( \"/users\" ) async def read_users2 (): return [ \"Bean\" , \"Elfo\" ] The first one will always be used since the path matches first. Predefined values \u00b6 If you have a path operation that receives a path parameter , but you want the possible valid path parameter values to be predefined, you can use a standard Python Enum . Create an Enum class \u00b6 Import Enum and create a sub-class that inherits from str and from Enum . By inheriting from str the API docs will be able to know that the values must be of type string and will be able to render correctly. Then create class attributes with fixed values, which will be the available valid values: from enum import Enum from fastapi import FastAPI class ModelName ( str , Enum ): alexnet = \"alexnet\" resnet = \"resnet\" lenet = \"lenet\" app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/models/ {model_name} \" ) async def get_model ( model_name : ModelName ): if model_name == ModelName . alexnet : return { \"model_name\" : model_name , \"message\" : \"Deep Learning FTW!\" } if model_name . value == \"lenet\" : return { \"model_name\" : model_name , \"message\" : \"LeCNN all the images\" } return { \"model_name\" : model_name , \"message\" : \"Have some residuals\" } Info Enumerations (or enums) are available in Python since version 3.4. Tip If you are wondering, \"AlexNet\", \"ResNet\", and \"LeNet\" are just names of Machine Learning models . Declare a path parameter \u00b6 Then create a path parameter with a type annotation using the enum class you created ( ModelName ): from enum import Enum from fastapi import FastAPI class ModelName ( str , Enum ): alexnet = \"alexnet\" resnet = \"resnet\" lenet = \"lenet\" app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/models/ {model_name} \" ) async def get_model ( model_name : ModelName ): if model_name == ModelName . alexnet : return { \"model_name\" : model_name , \"message\" : \"Deep Learning FTW!\" } if model_name . value == \"lenet\" : return { \"model_name\" : model_name , \"message\" : \"LeCNN all the images\" } return { \"model_name\" : model_name , \"message\" : \"Have some residuals\" } Check the docs \u00b6 Because the available values for the path parameter are predefined, the interactive docs can show them nicely: Working with Python enumerations \u00b6 The value of the path parameter will be an enumeration member . Compare enumeration members \u00b6 You can compare it with the enumeration member in your created enum ModelName : from enum import Enum from fastapi import FastAPI class ModelName ( str , Enum ): alexnet = \"alexnet\" resnet = \"resnet\" lenet = \"lenet\" app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/models/ {model_name} \" ) async def get_model ( model_name : ModelName ): if model_name == ModelName . alexnet : return { \"model_name\" : model_name , \"message\" : \"Deep Learning FTW!\" } if model_name . value == \"lenet\" : return { \"model_name\" : model_name , \"message\" : \"LeCNN all the images\" } return { \"model_name\" : model_name , \"message\" : \"Have some residuals\" } Get the enumeration value \u00b6 You can get the actual value (a str in this case) using model_name.value , or in general, your_enum_member.value : from enum import Enum from fastapi import FastAPI class ModelName ( str , Enum ): alexnet = \"alexnet\" resnet = \"resnet\" lenet = \"lenet\" app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/models/ {model_name} \" ) async def get_model ( model_name : ModelName ): if model_name == ModelName . alexnet : return { \"model_name\" : model_name , \"message\" : \"Deep Learning FTW!\" } if model_name . value == \"lenet\" : return { \"model_name\" : model_name , \"message\" : \"LeCNN all the images\" } return { \"model_name\" : model_name , \"message\" : \"Have some residuals\" } Tip You could also access the value \"lenet\" with ModelName.lenet.value . Return enumeration members \u00b6 You can return enum members from your path operation , even nested in a JSON body (e.g. a dict ). They will be converted to their corresponding values (strings in this case) before returning them to the client: from enum import Enum from fastapi import FastAPI class ModelName ( str , Enum ): alexnet = \"alexnet\" resnet = \"resnet\" lenet = \"lenet\" app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/models/ {model_name} \" ) async def get_model ( model_name : ModelName ): if model_name == ModelName . alexnet : return { \"model_name\" : model_name , \"message\" : \"Deep Learning FTW!\" } if model_name . value == \"lenet\" : return { \"model_name\" : model_name , \"message\" : \"LeCNN all the images\" } return { \"model_name\" : model_name , \"message\" : \"Have some residuals\" } In your client you will get a JSON response like: { \"model_name\" : \"alexnet\" , \"message\" : \"Deep Learning FTW!\" } Path parameters containing paths \u00b6 Let's say you have a path operation with a path /files/{file_path} . But you need file_path itself to contain a path , like home/johndoe/myfile.txt . So, the URL for that file would be something like: /files/home/johndoe/myfile.txt . OpenAPI support \u00b6 OpenAPI doesn't support a way to declare a path parameter to contain a path inside, as that could lead to scenarios that are difficult to test and define. Nevertheless, you can still do it in FastAPI , using one of the internal tools from Starlette. And the docs would still work, although not adding any documentation telling that the parameter should contain a path. Path convertor \u00b6 Using an option directly from Starlette you can declare a path parameter containing a path using a URL like: /files/{file_path:path} In this case, the name of the parameter is file_path , and the last part, :path , tells it that the parameter should match any path . So, you can use it with: from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/files/{file_path:path}\" ) async def read_file ( file_path : str ): return { \"file_path\" : file_path } Tip You could need the parameter to contain /home/johndoe/myfile.txt , with a leading slash ( / ). In that case, the URL would be: /files//home/johndoe/myfile.txt , with a double slash ( // ) between files and home . Recap \u00b6 With FastAPI , by using short, intuitive and standard Python type declarations, you get: Editor support: error checks, autocompletion, etc. Data \" parsing \" Data validation API annotation and automatic documentation And you only have to declare them once. That's probably the main visible advantage of FastAPI compared to alternative frameworks (apart from the raw performance).","title":"Path Parameters"},{"location":"tutorial/path-params/#path-parameters","text":"Warning The current page still doesn't have a translation for this language.

But you can help translating it: Contributing . FastAPI allows you to declare additional information and validation for your parameters. Let's take this application as example: Python 3.6 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( q : Union [ str , None ] = None ): results = { \"items\" : [{ \"item_id\" : \"Foo\" }, { \"item_id\" : \"Bar\" }]} if q : results . update ({ \"q\" : q }) return results from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( q : str | None = None ): results = { \"items\" : [{ \"item_id\" : \"Foo\" }, { \"item_id\" : \"Bar\" }]} if q : results . update ({ \"q\" : q }) return results The query parameter q is of type Union[str, None] (or str | None in Python 3.10), that means that it's of type str but could also be None , and indeed, the default value is None , so FastAPI will know it's not required. Note FastAPI will know that the value of q is not required because of the default value = None . The Union in Union[str, None] will allow your editor to give you better support and detect errors. Additional validation \u00b6 We are going to enforce that even though q is optional, whenever it is provided, its length doesn't exceed 50 characters . Import Query \u00b6 To achieve that, first import Query from fastapi : Python 3.6 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI , Query app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( q : Union [ str , None ] = Query ( default = None , max_length = 50 )): results = { \"items\" : [{ \"item_id\" : \"Foo\" }, { \"item_id\" : \"Bar\" }]} if q : results . update ({ \"q\" : q }) return results from fastapi import FastAPI , Query app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( q : str | None = Query ( default = None , max_length = 50 )): results = { \"items\" : [{ \"item_id\" : \"Foo\" }, { \"item_id\" : \"Bar\" }]} if q : results . update ({ \"q\" : q }) return results Use Query as the default value \u00b6 And now use it as the default value of your parameter, setting the parameter max_length to 50: Python 3.6 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI , Query app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( q : Union [ str , None ] = Query ( default = None , max_length = 50 )): results = { \"items\" : [{ \"item_id\" : \"Foo\" }, { \"item_id\" : \"Bar\" }]} if q : results . update ({ \"q\" : q }) return results from fastapi import FastAPI , Query app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( q : str | None = Query ( default = None , max_length = 50 )): results = { \"items\" : [{ \"item_id\" : \"Foo\" }, { \"item_id\" : \"Bar\" }]} if q : results . update ({ \"q\" : q }) return results As we have to replace the default value None in the function with Query() , we can now set the default value with the parameter Query(default=None) , it serves the same purpose of defining that default value. So: q : Union [ str , None ] = Query ( default = None ) ...makes the parameter optional, the same as: q : Union [ str , None ] = None And in Python 3.10 and above: q : str | None = Query ( default = None ) ...makes the parameter optional, the same as: q : str | None = None But it declares it explicitly as being a query parameter. Info Have in mind that the most important part to make a parameter optional is the part: = None or the: = Query ( default = None ) as it will use that None as the default value, and that way make the parameter not required . The Union[str, None] part allows your editor to provide better support, but it is not what tells FastAPI that this parameter is not required. Then, we can pass more parameters to Query . In this case, the max_length parameter that applies to strings: q : Union [ str , None ] = Query ( default = None , max_length = 50 ) This will validate the data, show a clear error when the data is not valid, and document the parameter in the OpenAPI schema path operation . Add more validations \u00b6 You can also add a parameter min_length : Python 3.6 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI , Query app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( q : Union [ str , None ] = Query ( default = None , min_length = 3 , max_length = 50 ) ): results = { \"items\" : [{ \"item_id\" : \"Foo\" }, { \"item_id\" : \"Bar\" }]} if q : results . update ({ \"q\" : q }) return results from fastapi import FastAPI , Query app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( q : str | None = Query ( default = None , min_length = 3 , max_length = 50 )): results = { \"items\" : [{ \"item_id\" : \"Foo\" }, { \"item_id\" : \"Bar\" }]} if q : results . update ({ \"q\" : q }) return results Add regular expressions \u00b6 You can define a regular expression that the parameter should match: Python 3.6 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI , Query app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( q : Union [ str , None ] = Query ( default = None , min_length = 3 , max_length = 50 , regex = \"^fixedquery$\" ) ): results = { \"items\" : [{ \"item_id\" : \"Foo\" }, { \"item_id\" : \"Bar\" }]} if q : results . update ({ \"q\" : q }) return results from fastapi import FastAPI , Query app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( q : str | None = Query ( default = None , min_length = 3 , max_length = 50 , regex = \"^fixedquery$\" ) ): results = { \"items\" : [{ \"item_id\" : \"Foo\" }, { \"item_id\" : \"Bar\" }]} if q : results . update ({ \"q\" : q }) return results This specific regular expression checks that the received parameter value: ^ : starts with the following characters, doesn't have characters before. fixedquery : has the exact value fixedquery . $ : ends there, doesn't have any more characters after fixedquery . If you feel lost with all these \"regular expression\" ideas, don't worry. They are a hard topic for many people. You can still do a lot of stuff without needing regular expressions yet. But whenever you need them and go and learn them, know that you can already use them directly in FastAPI . Default values \u00b6 The same way that you can pass None as the value for the default parameter, you can pass other values. Let's say that you want to declare the q query parameter to have a min_length of 3 , and to have a default value of \"fixedquery\" : from fastapi import FastAPI , Query app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( q : str = Query ( default = \"fixedquery\" , min_length = 3 )): results = { \"items\" : [{ \"item_id\" : \"Foo\" }, { \"item_id\" : \"Bar\" }]} if q : results . update ({ \"q\" : q }) return results Note Having a default value also makes the parameter optional. Make it required \u00b6 When we don't need to declare more validations or metadata, we can make the q query parameter required just by not declaring a default value, like: q : str instead of: q : Union [ str , None ] = None But we are now declaring it with Query , for example like: q : Union [ str , None ] = Query ( default = None , min_length = 3 ) So, when you need to declare a value as required while using Query , you can simply not declare a default value: from fastapi import FastAPI , Query app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( q : str = Query ( min_length = 3 )): results = { \"items\" : [{ \"item_id\" : \"Foo\" }, { \"item_id\" : \"Bar\" }]} if q : results . update ({ \"q\" : q }) return results Required with Ellipsis ( ... ) \u00b6 There's an alternative way to explicitly declare that a value is required. You can set the default parameter to the literal value ... : from fastapi import FastAPI , Query app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( q : str = Query ( default =... , min_length = 3 )): results = { \"items\" : [{ \"item_id\" : \"Foo\" }, { \"item_id\" : \"Bar\" }]} if q : results . update ({ \"q\" : q }) return results Info If you hadn't seen that ... before: it is a special single value, it is part of Python and is called \"Ellipsis\" . It is used by Pydantic and FastAPI to explicitly declare that a value is required. This will let FastAPI know that this parameter is required. Required with None \u00b6 You can declare that a parameter can accept None , but that it's still required. This would force clients to send a value, even if the value is None . To do that, you can declare that None is a valid type but still use default=... : Python 3.6 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI , Query app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( q : Union [ str , None ] = Query ( default =... , min_length = 3 )): results = { \"items\" : [{ \"item_id\" : \"Foo\" }, { \"item_id\" : \"Bar\" }]} if q : results . update ({ \"q\" : q }) return results from fastapi import FastAPI , Query app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( q : str | None = Query ( default =... , min_length = 3 )): results = { \"items\" : [{ \"item_id\" : \"Foo\" }, { \"item_id\" : \"Bar\" }]} if q : results . update ({ \"q\" : q }) return results Tip Pydantic, which is what powers all the data validation and serialization in FastAPI, has a special behavior when you use Optional or Union[Something, None] without a default value, you can read more about it in the Pydantic docs about Required Optional fields . Use Pydantic's Required instead of Ellipsis ( ... ) \u00b6 If you feel uncomfortable using ... , you can also import and use Required from Pydantic: from fastapi import FastAPI , Query from pydantic import Required app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( q : str = Query ( default = Required , min_length = 3 )): results = { \"items\" : [{ \"item_id\" : \"Foo\" }, { \"item_id\" : \"Bar\" }]} if q : results . update ({ \"q\" : q }) return results Tip Remember that in most of the cases, when something is required, you can simply omit the default parameter, so you normally don't have to use ... nor Required . Query parameter list / multiple values \u00b6 When you define a query parameter explicitly with Query you can also declare it to receive a list of values, or said in other way, to receive multiple values. For example, to declare a query parameter q that can appear multiple times in the URL, you can write: Python 3.6 and above Python 3.9 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import List , Union from fastapi import FastAPI , Query app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( q : Union [ List [ str ], None ] = Query ( default = None )): query_items = { \"q\" : q } return query_items from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI , Query app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( q : Union [ list [ str ], None ] = Query ( default = None )): query_items = { \"q\" : q } return query_items from fastapi import FastAPI , Query app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( q : list [ str ] | None = Query ( default = None )): query_items = { \"q\" : q } return query_items Then, with a URL like: http://localhost:8000/items/?q=foo&q=bar you would receive the multiple q query parameters' values ( foo and bar ) in a Python list inside your path operation function , in the function parameter q . So, the response to that URL would be: { \"q\" : [ \"foo\" , \"bar\" ] } Tip To declare a query parameter with a type of list , like in the example above, you need to explicitly use Query , otherwise it would be interpreted as a request body. The interactive API docs will update accordingly, to allow multiple values: Query parameter list / multiple values with defaults \u00b6 And you can also define a default list of values if none are provided: Python 3.6 and above Python 3.9 and above from typing import List from fastapi import FastAPI , Query app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( q : List [ str ] = Query ( default = [ \"foo\" , \"bar\" ])): query_items = { \"q\" : q } return query_items from fastapi import FastAPI , Query app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( q : list [ str ] = Query ( default = [ \"foo\" , \"bar\" ])): query_items = { \"q\" : q } return query_items If you go to: http://localhost:8000/items/ the default of q will be: [\"foo\", \"bar\"] and your response will be: { \"q\" : [ \"foo\" , \"bar\" ] } Using list \u00b6 You can also use list directly instead of List[str] (or list[str] in Python 3.9+): from fastapi import FastAPI , Query app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( q : list = Query ( default = [])): query_items = { \"q\" : q } return query_items Note Have in mind that in this case, FastAPI won't check the contents of the list. For example, List[int] would check (and document) that the contents of the list are integers. But list alone wouldn't. Declare more metadata \u00b6 You can add more information about the parameter. That information will be included in the generated OpenAPI and used by the documentation user interfaces and external tools. Note Have in mind that different tools might have different levels of OpenAPI support. Some of them might not show all the extra information declared yet, although in most of the cases, the missing feature is already planned for development. You can add a title : Python 3.6 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI , Query app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( q : Union [ str , None ] = Query ( default = None , title = \"Query string\" , min_length = 3 ) ): results = { \"items\" : [{ \"item_id\" : \"Foo\" }, { \"item_id\" : \"Bar\" }]} if q : results . update ({ \"q\" : q }) return results from fastapi import FastAPI , Query app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( q : str | None = Query ( default = None , title = \"Query string\" , min_length = 3 ) ): results = { \"items\" : [{ \"item_id\" : \"Foo\" }, { \"item_id\" : \"Bar\" }]} if q : results . update ({ \"q\" : q }) return results And a description : Python 3.6 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI , Query app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( q : Union [ str , None ] = Query ( default = None , title = \"Query string\" , description = \"Query string for the items to search in the database that have a good match\" , min_length = 3 , ) ): results = { \"items\" : [{ \"item_id\" : \"Foo\" }, { \"item_id\" : \"Bar\" }]} if q : results . update ({ \"q\" : q }) return results from fastapi import FastAPI , Query app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( q : str | None = Query ( default = None , title = \"Query string\" , description = \"Query string for the items to search in the database that have a good match\" , min_length = 3 , ) ): results = { \"items\" : [{ \"item_id\" : \"Foo\" }, { \"item_id\" : \"Bar\" }]} if q : results . update ({ \"q\" : q }) return results Alias parameters \u00b6 Imagine that you want the parameter to be item-query . Like in: http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/?item-query=foobaritems But item-query is not a valid Python variable name. The closest would be item_query . But you still need it to be exactly item-query ... Then you can declare an alias , and that alias is what will be used to find the parameter value: Python 3.6 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI , Query app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( q : Union [ str , None ] = Query ( default = None , alias = \"item-query\" )): results = { \"items\" : [{ \"item_id\" : \"Foo\" }, { \"item_id\" : \"Bar\" }]} if q : results . update ({ \"q\" : q }) return results from fastapi import FastAPI , Query app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( q : str | None = Query ( default = None , alias = \"item-query\" )): results = { \"items\" : [{ \"item_id\" : \"Foo\" }, { \"item_id\" : \"Bar\" }]} if q : results . update ({ \"q\" : q }) return results Deprecating parameters \u00b6 Now let's say you don't like this parameter anymore. You have to leave it there a while because there are clients using it, but you want the docs to clearly show it as deprecated . Then pass the parameter deprecated=True to Query : Python 3.6 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI , Query app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( q : Union [ str , None ] = Query ( default = None , alias = \"item-query\" , title = \"Query string\" , description = \"Query string for the items to search in the database that have a good match\" , min_length = 3 , max_length = 50 , regex = \"^fixedquery$\" , deprecated = True , ) ): results = { \"items\" : [{ \"item_id\" : \"Foo\" }, { \"item_id\" : \"Bar\" }]} if q : results . update ({ \"q\" : q }) return results from fastapi import FastAPI , Query app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( q : str | None = Query ( default = None , alias = \"item-query\" , title = \"Query string\" , description = \"Query string for the items to search in the database that have a good match\" , min_length = 3 , max_length = 50 , regex = \"^fixedquery$\" , deprecated = True , ) ): results = { \"items\" : [{ \"item_id\" : \"Foo\" }, { \"item_id\" : \"Bar\" }]} if q : results . update ({ \"q\" : q }) return results The docs will show it like this: Exclude from OpenAPI \u00b6 To exclude a query parameter from the generated OpenAPI schema (and thus, from the automatic documentation systems), set the parameter include_in_schema of Query to False : Python 3.6 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI , Query app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( hidden_query : Union [ str , None ] = Query ( default = None , include_in_schema = False ) ): if hidden_query : return { \"hidden_query\" : hidden_query } else : return { \"hidden_query\" : \"Not found\" } from fastapi import FastAPI , Query app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( hidden_query : str | None = Query ( default = None , include_in_schema = False ) ): if hidden_query : return { \"hidden_query\" : hidden_query } else : return { \"hidden_query\" : \"Not found\" } Recap \u00b6 You can declare additional validations and metadata for your parameters.

But you can help translating it: Contributing . You can define files to be uploaded by the client using File . Info To receive uploaded files, first install python-multipart . E.g. pip install python-multipart . This is because uploaded files are sent as \"form data\". Import File \u00b6 Import File and UploadFile from fastapi : from fastapi import FastAPI , File , UploadFile app = FastAPI () @app . post ( \"/files/\" ) async def create_file ( file : bytes = File ()): return { \"file_size\" : len ( file )} @app . post ( \"/uploadfile/\" ) async def create_upload_file ( file : UploadFile ): return { \"filename\" : file . filename } Define File Parameters \u00b6 Create file parameters the same way you would for Body or Form : from fastapi import FastAPI , File , UploadFile app = FastAPI () @app . post ( \"/files/\" ) async def create_file ( file : bytes = File ()): return { \"file_size\" : len ( file )} @app . post ( \"/uploadfile/\" ) async def create_upload_file ( file : UploadFile ): return { \"filename\" : file . filename } Info File is a class that inherits directly from Form . But remember that when you import Query , Path , File and others from fastapi , those are actually functions that return special classes. Tip To declare File bodies, you need to use File , because otherwise the parameters would be interpreted as query parameters or body (JSON) parameters. The files will be uploaded as \"form data\". If you declare the type of your path operation function parameter as bytes , FastAPI will read the file for you and you will receive the contents as bytes . Have in mind that this means that the whole contents will be stored in memory. This will work well for small files. But there are several cases in which you might benefit from using UploadFile . File Parameters with UploadFile \u00b6 Define a file parameter with a type of UploadFile : from fastapi import FastAPI , File , UploadFile app = FastAPI () @app . post ( \"/files/\" ) async def create_file ( file : bytes = File ()): return { \"file_size\" : len ( file )} @app . post ( \"/uploadfile/\" ) async def create_upload_file ( file : UploadFile ): return { \"filename\" : file . filename } Using UploadFile has several advantages over bytes : You don't have to use File() in the default value of the parameter. It uses a \"spooled\" file: A file stored in memory up to a maximum size limit, and after passing this limit it will be stored in disk. This means that it will work well for large files like images, videos, large binaries, etc. without consuming all the memory. You can get metadata from the uploaded file. It has a file-like async interface. It exposes an actual Python SpooledTemporaryFile object that you can pass directly to other libraries that expect a file-like object. UploadFile \u00b6 UploadFile has the following attributes: filename : A str with the original file name that was uploaded (e.g. myimage.jpg ). content_type : A str with the content type (MIME type / media type) (e.g. image/jpeg ). file : A SpooledTemporaryFile (a file-like object). This is the actual Python file that you can pass directly to other functions or libraries that expect a \"file-like\" object. UploadFile has the following async methods. They all call the corresponding file methods underneath (using the internal SpooledTemporaryFile ). write(data) : Writes data ( str or bytes ) to the file. read(size) : Reads size ( int ) bytes/characters of the file. seek(offset) : Goes to the byte position offset ( int ) in the file. E.g., await myfile.seek(0) would go to the start of the file. This is especially useful if you run await myfile.read() once and then need to read the contents again. close() : Closes the file. As all these methods are async methods, you need to \"await\" them. For example, inside of an async path operation function you can get the contents with: contents = await myfile . read () If you are inside of a normal def path operation function , you can access the UploadFile.file directly, for example: contents = myfile . file . read () async Technical Details When you use the async methods, FastAPI runs the file methods in a threadpool and awaits for them. Starlette Technical Details FastAPI 's UploadFile inherits directly from Starlette 's UploadFile , but adds some necessary parts to make it compatible with Pydantic and the other parts of FastAPI. What is \"Form Data\" \u00b6 The way HTML forms ( <form></form> ) sends the data to the server normally uses a \"special\" encoding for that data, it's different from JSON. FastAPI will make sure to read that data from the right place instead of JSON. Technical Details Data from forms is normally encoded using the \"media type\" application/x-www-form-urlencoded when it doesn't include files. But when the form includes files, it is encoded as multipart/form-data . If you use File , FastAPI will know it has to get the files from the correct part of the body. If you want to read more about these encodings and form fields, head to the MDN web docs for POST . Warning You can declare multiple File and Form parameters in a path operation , but you can't also declare Body fields that you expect to receive as JSON, as the request will have the body encoded using multipart/form-data instead of application/json . This is not a limitation of FastAPI , it's part of the HTTP protocol. Optional File Upload \u00b6 You can make a file optional by using standard type annotations and setting a default value of None : Python 3.6 and above Python 3.9 and above from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI , File , UploadFile app = FastAPI () @app . post ( \"/files/\" ) async def create_file ( file : Union [ bytes , None ] = File ( default = None )): if not file : return { \"message\" : \"No file sent\" } else : return { \"file_size\" : len ( file )} @app . post ( \"/uploadfile/\" ) async def create_upload_file ( file : Union [ UploadFile , None ] = None ): if not file : return { \"message\" : \"No upload file sent\" } else : return { \"filename\" : file . filename } from fastapi import FastAPI , File , UploadFile app = FastAPI () @app . post ( \"/files/\" ) async def create_file ( file : bytes | None = File ( default = None )): if not file : return { \"message\" : \"No file sent\" } else : return { \"file_size\" : len ( file )} @app . post ( \"/uploadfile/\" ) async def create_upload_file ( file : UploadFile | None = None ): if not file : return { \"message\" : \"No upload file sent\" } else : return { \"filename\" : file . filename } UploadFile with Additional Metadata \u00b6 You can also use File() with UploadFile , for example, to set additional metadata: from fastapi import FastAPI , File , UploadFile app = FastAPI () @app . post ( \"/files/\" ) async def create_file ( file : bytes = File ( description = \"A file read as bytes\" )): return { \"file_size\" : len ( file )} @app . post ( \"/uploadfile/\" ) async def create_upload_file ( file : UploadFile = File ( description = \"A file read as UploadFile\" ), ): return { \"filename\" : file . filename } Multiple File Uploads \u00b6 It's possible to upload several files at the same time. They would be associated to the same \"form field\" sent using \"form data\". To use that, declare a list of bytes or UploadFile : Python 3.6 and above Python 3.9 and above from typing import List from fastapi import FastAPI , File , UploadFile from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse app = FastAPI () @app . post ( \"/files/\" ) async def create_files ( files : List [ bytes ] = File ()): return { \"file_sizes\" : [ len ( file ) for file in files ]} @app . post ( \"/uploadfiles/\" ) async def create_upload_files ( files : List [ UploadFile ]): return { \"filenames\" : [ file . filename for file in files ]} @app . get ( \"/\" ) async def main (): content = \"\"\" <body> <form action=\"/files/\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\" method=\"post\"> <input name=\"files\" type=\"file\" multiple> <input type=\"submit\"> </form> <form action=\"/uploadfiles/\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\" method=\"post\"> <input name=\"files\" type=\"file\" multiple> <input type=\"submit\"> </form> </body> \"\"\" return HTMLResponse ( content = content ) from fastapi import FastAPI , File , UploadFile from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse app = FastAPI () @app . post ( \"/files/\" ) async def create_files ( files : list [ bytes ] = File ()): return { \"file_sizes\" : [ len ( file ) for file in files ]} @app . post ( \"/uploadfiles/\" ) async def create_upload_files ( files : list [ UploadFile ]): return { \"filenames\" : [ file . filename for file in files ]} @app . get ( \"/\" ) async def main (): content = \"\"\" <body> <form action=\"/files/\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\" method=\"post\"> <input name=\"files\" type=\"file\" multiple> <input type=\"submit\"> </form> <form action=\"/uploadfiles/\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\" method=\"post\"> <input name=\"files\" type=\"file\" multiple> <input type=\"submit\"> </form> </body> \"\"\" return HTMLResponse ( content = content ) You will receive, as declared, a list of bytes or UploadFile s. Technical Details You could also use from starlette.responses import HTMLResponse . FastAPI provides the same starlette.responses as fastapi.responses just as a convenience for you, the developer. But most of the available responses come directly from Starlette. Multiple File Uploads with Additional Metadata \u00b6 And the same way as before, you can use File() to set additional parameters, even for UploadFile : Python 3.6 and above Python 3.9 and above from typing import List from fastapi import FastAPI , File , UploadFile from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse app = FastAPI () @app . post ( \"/files/\" ) async def create_files ( files : List [ bytes ] = File ( description = \"Multiple files as bytes\" ), ): return { \"file_sizes\" : [ len ( file ) for file in files ]} @app . post ( \"/uploadfiles/\" ) async def create_upload_files ( files : List [ UploadFile ] = File ( description = \"Multiple files as UploadFile\" ), ): return { \"filenames\" : [ file . filename for file in files ]} @app . get ( \"/\" ) async def main (): content = \"\"\" <body> <form action=\"/files/\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\" method=\"post\"> <input name=\"files\" type=\"file\" multiple> <input type=\"submit\"> </form> <form action=\"/uploadfiles/\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\" method=\"post\"> <input name=\"files\" type=\"file\" multiple> <input type=\"submit\"> </form> </body> \"\"\" return HTMLResponse ( content = content ) from fastapi import FastAPI , File , UploadFile from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse app = FastAPI () @app . post ( \"/files/\" ) async def create_files ( files : list [ bytes ] = File ( description = \"Multiple files as bytes\" ), ): return { \"file_sizes\" : [ len ( file ) for file in files ]} @app . post ( \"/uploadfiles/\" ) async def create_upload_files ( files : list [ UploadFile ] = File ( description = \"Multiple files as UploadFile\" ), ): return { \"filenames\" : [ file . filename for file in files ]} @app . get ( \"/\" ) async def main (): content = \"\"\" <body> <form action=\"/files/\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\" method=\"post\"> <input name=\"files\" type=\"file\" multiple> <input type=\"submit\"> </form> <form action=\"/uploadfiles/\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\" method=\"post\"> <input name=\"files\" type=\"file\" multiple> <input type=\"submit\"> </form> </body> \"\"\" return HTMLResponse ( content = content ) Recap \u00b6 Use File , bytes , and UploadFile to declare files to be uploaded in the request, sent as form data.","title":"Request Files"},{"location":"tutorial/request-files/#request-files","text":"Warning The current page still doesn't have a translation for this language.

So, if you send a request to that path operation for the item with ID foo , the response (not including default values) will be: { \"name\" : \"Foo\" , \"price\" : 50.2 } Info FastAPI uses Pydantic model's .dict() with its exclude_unset parameter to achieve this. Info You can also use: response_model_exclude_defaults=True response_model_exclude_none=True as described in the Pydantic docs for exclude_defaults and exclude_none . Data with values for fields with defaults \u00b6 But if your data has values for the model's fields with default values, like the item with ID bar : { \"name\" : \"Bar\" , \"description\" : \"The bartenders\" , \"price\" : 62 , \"tax\" : 20.2 } they will be included in the response. Data with the same values as the defaults \u00b6 If the data has the same values as the default ones, like the item with ID baz : { \"name\" : \"Baz\" , \"description\" : None , \"price\" : 50.2 , \"tax\" : 10.5 , \"tags\" : [] } FastAPI is smart enough (actually, Pydantic is smart enough) to realize that, even though description , tax , and tags have the same values as the defaults, they were set explicitly (instead of taken from the defaults). So, they will be included in the JSON response. Tip Notice that the default values can be anything, not only None . They can be a list ( [] ), a float of 10.5 , etc. response_model_include and response_model_exclude \u00b6 You can also use the path operation decorator parameters response_model_include and response_model_exclude . They take a set of str with the name of the attributes to include (omitting the rest) or to exclude (including the rest). This can be used as a quick shortcut if you have only one Pydantic model and want to remove some data from the output. Tip But it is still recommended to use the ideas above, using multiple classes, instead of these parameters. This is because the JSON Schema generated in your app's OpenAPI (and the docs) will still be the one for the complete model, even if you use response_model_include or response_model_exclude to omit some attributes. This also applies to response_model_by_alias that works similarly.

If the ideas above already work for you, that might be enough, and you probably don't need these details, feel free to skip them. When you add an example inside of a Pydantic model, using schema_extra or Field(example=\"something\") that example is added to the JSON Schema for that Pydantic model. And that JSON Schema of the Pydantic model is included in the OpenAPI of your API, and then it's used in the docs UI. JSON Schema doesn't really have a field example in the standards. Recent versions of JSON Schema define a field examples , but OpenAPI 3.0.3 is based on an older version of JSON Schema that didn't have examples . So, OpenAPI 3.0.3 defined its own example for the modified version of JSON Schema it uses, for the same purpose (but it's a single example , not examples ), and that's what is used by the API docs UI (using Swagger UI). So, although example is not part of JSON Schema, it is part of OpenAPI's custom version of JSON Schema, and that's what will be used by the docs UI. But when you use example or examples with any of the other utilities ( Query() , Body() , etc.) those examples are not added to the JSON Schema that describes that data (not even to OpenAPI's own version of JSON Schema), they are added directly to the path operation declaration in OpenAPI (outside the parts of OpenAPI that use JSON Schema). For Path() , Query() , Header() , and Cookie() , the example or examples are added to the OpenAPI definition, to the Parameter Object (in the specification) . And for Body() , File() , and Form() , the example or examples are equivalently added to the OpenAPI definition, to the Request Body Object , in the field content , on the Media Type Object (in the specification) .

But you can help translating it: Contributing . FastAPI doesn't require you to use a SQL (relational) database. But you can use any relational database that you want. Here we'll see an example using SQLAlchemy . You can easily adapt it to any database supported by SQLAlchemy, like: PostgreSQL MySQL SQLite Oracle Microsoft SQL Server, etc. In this example, we'll use SQLite , because it uses a single file and Python has integrated support. So, you can copy this example and run it as is. Later, for your production application, you might want to use a database server like PostgreSQL . Tip There is an official project generator with FastAPI and PostgreSQL , all based on Docker , including a frontend and more tools: https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack-fastapi-postgresql Note Notice that most of the code is the standard SQLAlchemy code you would use with any framework. The FastAPI specific code is as small as always. ORMs \u00b6 FastAPI works with any database and any style of library to talk to the database. A common pattern is to use an \"ORM\": an \"object-relational mapping\" library. An ORM has tools to convert (\" map \") between objects in code and database tables (\" relations \"). With an ORM, you normally create a class that represents a table in a SQL database, each attribute of the class represents a column, with a name and a type. For example a class Pet could represent a SQL table pets . And each instance object of that class represents a row in the database. For example an object orion_cat (an instance of Pet ) could have an attribute orion_cat.type , for the column type . And the value of that attribute could be, e.g. \"cat\" . These ORMs also have tools to make the connections or relations between tables or entities. This way, you could also have an attribute orion_cat.owner and the owner would contain the data for this pet's owner, taken from the table owners . So, orion_cat.owner.name could be the name (from the name column in the owners table) of this pet's owner. It could have a value like \"Arquilian\" . And the ORM will do all the work to get the information from the corresponding table owners when you try to access it from your pet object. Common ORMs are for example: Django-ORM (part of the Django framework), SQLAlchemy ORM (part of SQLAlchemy, independent of framework) and Peewee (independent of framework), among others. Here we will see how to work with SQLAlchemy ORM . In a similar way you could use any other ORM. Tip There's an equivalent article using Peewee here in the docs. File structure \u00b6 For these examples, let's say you have a directory named my_super_project that contains a sub-directory called sql_app with a structure like this: . \u2514\u2500\u2500 sql_app \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py \u251c\u2500\u2500 crud.py \u251c\u2500\u2500 database.py \u251c\u2500\u2500 main.py \u251c\u2500\u2500 models.py \u2514\u2500\u2500 schemas.py The file __init__.py is just an empty file, but it tells Python that sql_app with all its modules (Python files) is a package. Now let's see what each file/module does. Create the SQLAlchemy parts \u00b6 Let's refer to the file sql_app/database.py . Import the SQLAlchemy parts \u00b6 from sqlalchemy import create_engine from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = \"sqlite:///./sql_app.db\" # SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = \"postgresql://user:password@postgresserver/db\" engine = create_engine ( SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL , connect_args = { \"check_same_thread\" : False } ) SessionLocal = sessionmaker ( autocommit = False , autoflush = False , bind = engine ) Base = declarative_base () Create a database URL for SQLAlchemy \u00b6 from sqlalchemy import create_engine from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = \"sqlite:///./sql_app.db\" # SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = \"postgresql://user:password@postgresserver/db\" engine = create_engine ( SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL , connect_args = { \"check_same_thread\" : False } ) SessionLocal = sessionmaker ( autocommit = False , autoflush = False , bind = engine ) Base = declarative_base () In this example, we are \"connecting\" to a SQLite database (opening a file with the SQLite database). The file will be located at the same directory in the file sql_app.db . That's why the last part is ./sql_app.db . If you were using a PostgreSQL database instead, you would just have to uncomment the line: SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = \"postgresql://user:password@postgresserver/db\" ...and adapt it with your database data and credentials (equivalently for MySQL, MariaDB or any other). Tip This is the main line that you would have to modify if you wanted to use a different database. Create the SQLAlchemy engine \u00b6 The first step is to create a SQLAlchemy \"engine\". We will later use this engine in other places. from sqlalchemy import create_engine from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = \"sqlite:///./sql_app.db\" # SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = \"postgresql://user:password@postgresserver/db\" engine = create_engine ( SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL , connect_args = { \"check_same_thread\" : False } ) SessionLocal = sessionmaker ( autocommit = False , autoflush = False , bind = engine ) Base = declarative_base () Note \u00b6 The argument: connect_args = { \"check_same_thread\" : False } ...is needed only for SQLite . It's not needed for other databases. Technical Details By default SQLite will only allow one thread to communicate with it, assuming that each thread would handle an independent request. This is to prevent accidentally sharing the same connection for different things (for different requests). But in FastAPI, using normal functions ( def ) more than one thread could interact with the database for the same request, so we need to make SQLite know that it should allow that with connect_args={\"check_same_thread\": False} . Also, we will make sure each request gets its own database connection session in a dependency, so there's no need for that default mechanism. Create a SessionLocal class \u00b6 Each instance of the SessionLocal class will be a database session. The class itself is not a database session yet. But once we create an instance of the SessionLocal class, this instance will be the actual database session. We name it SessionLocal to distinguish it from the Session we are importing from SQLAlchemy. We will use Session (the one imported from SQLAlchemy) later. To create the SessionLocal class, use the function sessionmaker : from sqlalchemy import create_engine from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = \"sqlite:///./sql_app.db\" # SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = \"postgresql://user:password@postgresserver/db\" engine = create_engine ( SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL , connect_args = { \"check_same_thread\" : False } ) SessionLocal = sessionmaker ( autocommit = False , autoflush = False , bind = engine ) Base = declarative_base () Create a Base class \u00b6 Now we will use the function declarative_base() that returns a class. Later we will inherit from this class to create each of the database models or classes (the ORM models): from sqlalchemy import create_engine from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = \"sqlite:///./sql_app.db\" # SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = \"postgresql://user:password@postgresserver/db\" engine = create_engine ( SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL , connect_args = { \"check_same_thread\" : False } ) SessionLocal = sessionmaker ( autocommit = False , autoflush = False , bind = engine ) Base = declarative_base () Create the database models \u00b6 Let's now see the file sql_app/models.py . Create SQLAlchemy models from the Base class \u00b6 We will use this Base class we created before to create the SQLAlchemy models. Tip SQLAlchemy uses the term \" model \" to refer to these classes and instances that interact with the database. But Pydantic also uses the term \" model \" to refer to something different, the data validation, conversion, and documentation classes and instances. Import Base from database (the file database.py from above). Create classes that inherit from it. These classes are the SQLAlchemy models. from sqlalchemy import Boolean , Column , ForeignKey , Integer , String from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship from .database import Base class User ( Base ): __tablename__ = \"users\" id = Column ( Integer , primary_key = True , index = True ) email = Column ( String , unique = True , index = True ) hashed_password = Column ( String ) is_active = Column ( Boolean , default = True ) items = relationship ( \"Item\" , back_populates = \"owner\" ) class Item ( Base ): __tablename__ = \"items\" id = Column ( Integer , primary_key = True , index = True ) title = Column ( String , index = True ) description = Column ( String , index = True ) owner_id = Column ( Integer , ForeignKey ( \"users.id\" )) owner = relationship ( \"User\" , back_populates = \"items\" ) The __tablename__ attribute tells SQLAlchemy the name of the table to use in the database for each of these models. Create model attributes/columns \u00b6 Now create all the model (class) attributes. Each of these attributes represents a column in its corresponding database table. We use Column from SQLAlchemy as the default value. And we pass a SQLAlchemy class \"type\", as Integer , String , and Boolean , that defines the type in the database, as an argument. from sqlalchemy import Boolean , Column , ForeignKey , Integer , String from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship from .database import Base class User ( Base ): __tablename__ = \"users\" id = Column ( Integer , primary_key = True , index = True ) email = Column ( String , unique = True , index = True ) hashed_password = Column ( String ) is_active = Column ( Boolean , default = True ) items = relationship ( \"Item\" , back_populates = \"owner\" ) class Item ( Base ): __tablename__ = \"items\" id = Column ( Integer , primary_key = True , index = True ) title = Column ( String , index = True ) description = Column ( String , index = True ) owner_id = Column ( Integer , ForeignKey ( \"users.id\" )) owner = relationship ( \"User\" , back_populates = \"items\" ) Create the relationships \u00b6 Now create the relationships. For this, we use relationship provided by SQLAlchemy ORM. This will become, more or less, a \"magic\" attribute that will contain the values from other tables related to this one. from sqlalchemy import Boolean , Column , ForeignKey , Integer , String from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship from .database import Base class User ( Base ): __tablename__ = \"users\" id = Column ( Integer , primary_key = True , index = True ) email = Column ( String , unique = True , index = True ) hashed_password = Column ( String ) is_active = Column ( Boolean , default = True ) items = relationship ( \"Item\" , back_populates = \"owner\" ) class Item ( Base ): __tablename__ = \"items\" id = Column ( Integer , primary_key = True , index = True ) title = Column ( String , index = True ) description = Column ( String , index = True ) owner_id = Column ( Integer , ForeignKey ( \"users.id\" )) owner = relationship ( \"User\" , back_populates = \"items\" ) When accessing the attribute items in a User , as in my_user.items , it will have a list of Item SQLAlchemy models (from the items table) that have a foreign key pointing to this record in the users table. When you access my_user.items , SQLAlchemy will actually go and fetch the items from the database in the items table and populate them here. And when accessing the attribute owner in an Item , it will contain a User SQLAlchemy model from the users table. It will use the owner_id attribute/column with its foreign key to know which record to get from the users table. Create the Pydantic models \u00b6 Now let's check the file sql_app/schemas.py . Tip To avoid confusion between the SQLAlchemy models and the Pydantic models , we will have the file models.py with the SQLAlchemy models, and the file schemas.py with the Pydantic models. These Pydantic models define more or less a \"schema\" (a valid data shape). So this will help us avoiding confusion while using both. Create initial Pydantic models / schemas \u00b6 Create an ItemBase and UserBase Pydantic models (or let's say \"schemas\") to have common attributes while creating or reading data. And create an ItemCreate and UserCreate that inherit from them (so they will have the same attributes), plus any additional data (attributes) needed for creation. So, the user will also have a password when creating it. But for security, the password won't be in other Pydantic models , for example, it won't be sent from the API when reading a user. Python 3.6 and above Python 3.9 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import List , Union from pydantic import BaseModel class ItemBase ( BaseModel ): title : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None class ItemCreate ( ItemBase ): pass class Item ( ItemBase ): id : int owner_id : int class Config : orm_mode = True class UserBase ( BaseModel ): email : str class UserCreate ( UserBase ): password : str class User ( UserBase ): id : int is_active : bool items : List [ Item ] = [] class Config : orm_mode = True from typing import Union from pydantic import BaseModel class ItemBase ( BaseModel ): title : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None class ItemCreate ( ItemBase ): pass class Item ( ItemBase ): id : int owner_id : int class Config : orm_mode = True class UserBase ( BaseModel ): email : str class UserCreate ( UserBase ): password : str class User ( UserBase ): id : int is_active : bool items : list [ Item ] = [] class Config : orm_mode = True from pydantic import BaseModel class ItemBase ( BaseModel ): title : str description : str | None = None class ItemCreate ( ItemBase ): pass class Item ( ItemBase ): id : int owner_id : int class Config : orm_mode = True class UserBase ( BaseModel ): email : str class UserCreate ( UserBase ): password : str class User ( UserBase ): id : int is_active : bool items : list [ Item ] = [] class Config : orm_mode = True SQLAlchemy style and Pydantic style \u00b6 Notice that SQLAlchemy models define attributes using = , and pass the type as a parameter to Column , like in: name = Column ( String ) while Pydantic models declare the types using : , the new type annotation syntax/type hints: name : str Have it in mind, so you don't get confused when using = and : with them. Create Pydantic models / schemas for reading / returning \u00b6 Now create Pydantic models (schemas) that will be used when reading data, when returning it from the API. For example, before creating an item, we don't know what will be the ID assigned to it, but when reading it (when returning it from the API) we will already know its ID. The same way, when reading a user, we can now declare that items will contain the items that belong to this user. Not only the IDs of those items, but all the data that we defined in the Pydantic model for reading items: Item . Python 3.6 and above Python 3.9 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import List , Union from pydantic import BaseModel class ItemBase ( BaseModel ): title : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None class ItemCreate ( ItemBase ): pass class Item ( ItemBase ): id : int owner_id : int class Config : orm_mode = True class UserBase ( BaseModel ): email : str class UserCreate ( UserBase ): password : str class User ( UserBase ): id : int is_active : bool items : List [ Item ] = [] class Config : orm_mode = True from typing import Union from pydantic import BaseModel class ItemBase ( BaseModel ): title : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None class ItemCreate ( ItemBase ): pass class Item ( ItemBase ): id : int owner_id : int class Config : orm_mode = True class UserBase ( BaseModel ): email : str class UserCreate ( UserBase ): password : str class User ( UserBase ): id : int is_active : bool items : list [ Item ] = [] class Config : orm_mode = True from pydantic import BaseModel class ItemBase ( BaseModel ): title : str description : str | None = None class ItemCreate ( ItemBase ): pass class Item ( ItemBase ): id : int owner_id : int class Config : orm_mode = True class UserBase ( BaseModel ): email : str class UserCreate ( UserBase ): password : str class User ( UserBase ): id : int is_active : bool items : list [ Item ] = [] class Config : orm_mode = True Tip Notice that the User , the Pydantic model that will be used when reading a user (returning it from the API) doesn't include the password . Use Pydantic's orm_mode \u00b6 Now, in the Pydantic models for reading, Item and User , add an internal Config class. This Config class is used to provide configurations to Pydantic. In the Config class, set the attribute orm_mode = True . Python 3.6 and above Python 3.9 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import List , Union from pydantic import BaseModel class ItemBase ( BaseModel ): title : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None class ItemCreate ( ItemBase ): pass class Item ( ItemBase ): id : int owner_id : int class Config : orm_mode = True class UserBase ( BaseModel ): email : str class UserCreate ( UserBase ): password : str class User ( UserBase ): id : int is_active : bool items : List [ Item ] = [] class Config : orm_mode = True from typing import Union from pydantic import BaseModel class ItemBase ( BaseModel ): title : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None class ItemCreate ( ItemBase ): pass class Item ( ItemBase ): id : int owner_id : int class Config : orm_mode = True class UserBase ( BaseModel ): email : str class UserCreate ( UserBase ): password : str class User ( UserBase ): id : int is_active : bool items : list [ Item ] = [] class Config : orm_mode = True from pydantic import BaseModel class ItemBase ( BaseModel ): title : str description : str | None = None class ItemCreate ( ItemBase ): pass class Item ( ItemBase ): id : int owner_id : int class Config : orm_mode = True class UserBase ( BaseModel ): email : str class UserCreate ( UserBase ): password : str class User ( UserBase ): id : int is_active : bool items : list [ Item ] = [] class Config : orm_mode = True Tip Notice it's assigning a value with = , like: orm_mode = True It doesn't use : as for the type declarations before. This is setting a config value, not declaring a type. Pydantic's orm_mode will tell the Pydantic model to read the data even if it is not a dict , but an ORM model (or any other arbitrary object with attributes). This way, instead of only trying to get the id value from a dict , as in: id = data [ \"id\" ] it will also try to get it from an attribute, as in: id = data . id And with this, the Pydantic model is compatible with ORMs, and you can just declare it in the response_model argument in your path operations . You will be able to return a database model and it will read the data from it. Technical Details about ORM mode \u00b6 SQLAlchemy and many others are by default \"lazy loading\". That means, for example, that they don't fetch the data for relationships from the database unless you try to access the attribute that would contain that data. For example, accessing the attribute items : current_user . items would make SQLAlchemy go to the items table and get the items for this user, but not before. Without orm_mode , if you returned a SQLAlchemy model from your path operation , it wouldn't include the relationship data. Even if you declared those relationships in your Pydantic models. But with ORM mode, as Pydantic itself will try to access the data it needs from attributes (instead of assuming a dict ), you can declare the specific data you want to return and it will be able to go and get it, even from ORMs. CRUD utils \u00b6 Now let's see the file sql_app/crud.py . In this file we will have reusable functions to interact with the data in the database. CRUD comes from: C reate, R ead, U pdate, and D elete. ...although in this example we are only creating and reading. Read data \u00b6 Import Session from sqlalchemy.orm , this will allow you to declare the type of the db parameters and have better type checks and completion in your functions. Import models (the SQLAlchemy models) and schemas (the Pydantic models / schemas). Create utility functions to: Read a single user by ID and by email. Read multiple users. Read multiple items. from sqlalchemy.orm import Session from . import models , schemas def get_user ( db : Session , user_id : int ): return db . query ( models . User ) . filter ( models .

Create data \u00b6 Now create utility functions to create data. The steps are: Create a SQLAlchemy model instance with your data. add that instance object to your database session. commit the changes to the database (so that they are saved). refresh your instance (so that it contains any new data from the database, like the generated ID). from sqlalchemy.orm import Session from . import models , schemas def get_user ( db : Session , user_id : int ): return db . query ( models .

Item ( ** item . dict (), owner_id = user_id ) db . add ( db_item ) db . commit () db . refresh ( db_item ) return db_item Tip The SQLAlchemy model for User contains a hashed_password that should contain a secure hashed version of the password. But as what the API client provides is the original password, you need to extract it and generate the hashed password in your application. And then pass the hashed_password argument with the value to save. Warning This example is not secure, the password is not hashed. In a real life application you would need to hash the password and never save them in plaintext. For more details, go back to the Security section in the tutorial. Here we are focusing only on the tools and mechanics of databases. Tip Instead of passing each of the keyword arguments to Item and reading each one of them from the Pydantic model , we are generating a dict with the Pydantic model 's data with: item.dict() and then we are passing the dict 's key-value pairs as the keyword arguments to the SQLAlchemy Item , with: Item(**item.dict()) And then we pass the extra keyword argument owner_id that is not provided by the Pydantic model , with: Item(**item.dict(), owner_id=user_id) Main FastAPI app \u00b6 And now in the file sql_app/main.py let's integrate and use all the other parts we created before.

And you would also use Alembic for \"migrations\" (that's its main job). A \"migration\" is the set of steps needed whenever you change the structure of your SQLAlchemy models, add a new attribute, etc. to replicate those changes in the database, add a new column, a new table, etc. You can find an example of Alembic in a FastAPI project in the templates from Project Generation - Template . Specifically in the alembic directory in the source code . Create a dependency \u00b6 Now use the SessionLocal class we created in the sql_app/database.py file to create a dependency. We need to have an independent database session/connection ( SessionLocal ) per request, use the same session through all the request and then close it after the request is finished. And then a new session will be created for the next request. For that, we will create a new dependency with yield , as explained before in the section about Dependencies with yield . Our dependency will create a new SQLAlchemy SessionLocal that will be used in a single request, and then close it once the request is finished.

And then we close it in the finally block. This way we make sure the database session is always closed after the request. Even if there was an exception while processing the request. But you can't raise another exception from the exit code (after yield ). See more in Dependencies with yield and HTTPException And then, when using the dependency in a path operation function , we declare it with the type Session we imported directly from SQLAlchemy. This will then give us better editor support inside the path operation function , because the editor will know that the db parameter is of type Session : Python 3.6 and above Python 3.9 and above from typing import List from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI , HTTPException from sqlalchemy.orm import Session from . import crud , models , schemas from .database import SessionLocal , engine models .

But by declaring the type as Session , the editor now can know the available methods ( .add() , .query() , .commit() , etc) and can provide better support (like completion). The type declaration doesn't affect the actual object. Create your FastAPI path operations \u00b6 Now, finally, here's the standard FastAPI path operations code.

And then we can create the required dependency in the path operation function , to get that session directly. With that, we can just call crud.get_user directly from inside of the path operation function and use that session. Tip Notice that the values you return are SQLAlchemy models, or lists of SQLAlchemy models. But as all the path operations have a response_model with Pydantic models / schemas using orm_mode , the data declared in your Pydantic models will be extracted from them and returned to the client, with all the normal filtering and validation. Tip Also notice that there are response_models that have standard Python types like List[schemas.Item] . But as the content/parameter of that List is a Pydantic model with orm_mode , the data will be retrieved and returned to the client as normally, without problems. About def vs async def \u00b6 Here we are using SQLAlchemy code inside of the path operation function and in the dependency, and, in turn, it will go and communicate with an external database. That could potentially require some \"waiting\". But as SQLAlchemy doesn't have compatibility for using await directly, as would be with something like: user = await db . query ( User ) . first () ...and instead we are using: user = db . query ( User ) . first () Then we should declare the path operation functions and the dependency without async def , just with a normal def , as: @app . get ( \"/users/ {user_id} \" , response_model = schemas . User ) def read_user ( user_id : int , db : Session = Depends ( get_db )): db_user = crud . get_user ( db , user_id = user_id ) ... Info If you need to connect to your relational database asynchronously, see Async SQL (Relational) Databases . Very Technical Details If you are curious and have a deep technical knowledge, you can check the very technical details of how this async def vs def is handled in the Async docs. Migrations \u00b6 Because we are using SQLAlchemy directly and we don't require any kind of plug-in for it to work with FastAPI , we could integrate database migrations with Alembic directly. And as the code related to SQLAlchemy and the SQLAlchemy models lives in separate independent files, you would even be able to perform the migrations with Alembic without having to install FastAPI, Pydantic, or anything else. The same way, you would be able to use the same SQLAlchemy models and utilities in other parts of your code that are not related to FastAPI . For example, in a background task worker with Celery , RQ , or ARQ . Review all the files \u00b6 Remember you should have a directory named my_super_project that contains a sub-directory called sql_app . sql_app should have the following files: sql_app/__init__.py : is an empty file. sql_app/database.py : from sqlalchemy import create_engine from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = \"sqlite:///./sql_app.db\" # SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = \"postgresql://user:password@postgresserver/db\" engine = create_engine ( SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL , connect_args = { \"check_same_thread\" : False } ) SessionLocal = sessionmaker ( autocommit = False , autoflush = False , bind = engine ) Base = declarative_base () sql_app/models.py : from sqlalchemy import Boolean , Column , ForeignKey , Integer , String from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship from .database import Base class User ( Base ): __tablename__ = \"users\" id = Column ( Integer , primary_key = True , index = True ) email = Column ( String , unique = True , index = True ) hashed_password = Column ( String ) is_active = Column ( Boolean , default = True ) items = relationship ( \"Item\" , back_populates = \"owner\" ) class Item ( Base ): __tablename__ = \"items\" id = Column ( Integer , primary_key = True , index = True ) title = Column ( String , index = True ) description = Column ( String , index = True ) owner_id = Column ( Integer , ForeignKey ( \"users.id\" )) owner = relationship ( \"User\" , back_populates = \"items\" ) sql_app/schemas.py : Python 3.6 and above Python 3.9 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import List , Union from pydantic import BaseModel class ItemBase ( BaseModel ): title : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None class ItemCreate ( ItemBase ): pass class Item ( ItemBase ): id : int owner_id : int class Config : orm_mode = True class UserBase ( BaseModel ): email : str class UserCreate ( UserBase ): password : str class User ( UserBase ): id : int is_active : bool items : List [ Item ] = [] class Config : orm_mode = True from typing import Union from pydantic import BaseModel class ItemBase ( BaseModel ): title : str description : Union [ str , None ] = None class ItemCreate ( ItemBase ): pass class Item ( ItemBase ): id : int owner_id : int class Config : orm_mode = True class UserBase ( BaseModel ): email : str class UserCreate ( UserBase ): password : str class User ( UserBase ): id : int is_active : bool items : list [ Item ] = [] class Config : orm_mode = True from pydantic import BaseModel class ItemBase ( BaseModel ): title : str description : str | None = None class ItemCreate ( ItemBase ): pass class Item ( ItemBase ): id : int owner_id : int class Config : orm_mode = True class UserBase ( BaseModel ): email : str class UserCreate ( UserBase ): password : str class User ( UserBase ): id : int is_active : bool items : list [ Item ] = [] class Config : orm_mode = True sql_app/crud.py : from sqlalchemy.orm import Session from . import models , schemas def get_user ( db : Session , user_id : int ): return db . query ( models .

Alternative DB session with middleware \u00b6 If you can't use dependencies with yield -- for example, if you are not using Python 3.7 and can't install the \"backports\" mentioned above for Python 3.6 -- you can set up the session in a \"middleware\" in a similar way. A \"middleware\" is basically a function that is always executed for each request, with some code executed before, and some code executed after the endpoint function. Create a middleware \u00b6 The middleware we'll add (just a function) will create a new SQLAlchemy SessionLocal for each request, add it to the request and then close it once the request is finished.

And then we close it in the finally block. This way we make sure the database session is always closed after the request. Even if there was an exception while processing the request. About request.state \u00b6 request.state is a property of each Request object. It is there to store arbitrary objects attached to the request itself, like the database session in this case. You can read more about it in Starlette's docs about Request state . For us in this case, it helps us ensure a single database session is used through all the request, and then closed afterwards (in the middleware). Dependencies with yield or middleware \u00b6 Adding a middleware here is similar to what a dependency with yield does, with some differences: It requires more code and is a bit more complex. The middleware has to be an async function. If there is code in it that has to \"wait\" for the network, it could \"block\" your application there and degrade performance a bit. Although it's probably not very problematic here with the way SQLAlchemy works. But if you added more code to the middleware that had a lot of I/O waiting, it could then be problematic. A middleware is run for every request. So, a connection will be created for every request. Even when the path operation that handles that request didn't need the DB. Tip It's probably better to use dependencies with yield when they are enough for the use case. Info Dependencies with yield were added recently to FastAPI . A previous version of this tutorial only had the examples with a middleware and there are probably several applications using the middleware for database session management.","title":"SQL (Relational) Databases"},{"location":"tutorial/sql-databases/#sql-relational-databases","text":"Warning The current page still doesn't have a translation for this language.

Here we'll see an example using SQLAlchemy . You can easily adapt it to any database supported by SQLAlchemy, like: PostgreSQL MySQL SQLite Oracle Microsoft SQL Server, etc. In this example, we'll use SQLite , because it uses a single file and Python has integrated support. So, you can copy this example and run it as is. Later, for your production application, you might want to use a database server like PostgreSQL . Tip There is an official project generator with FastAPI and PostgreSQL , all based on Docker , including a frontend and more tools: https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack-fastapi-postgresql Note Notice that most of the code is the standard SQLAlchemy code you would use with any framework.

A common pattern is to use an \"ORM\": an \"object-relational mapping\" library. An ORM has tools to convert (\" map \") between objects in code and database tables (\" relations \"). With an ORM, you normally create a class that represents a table in a SQL database, each attribute of the class represents a column, with a name and a type. For example a class Pet could represent a SQL table pets . And each instance object of that class represents a row in the database. For example an object orion_cat (an instance of Pet ) could have an attribute orion_cat.type , for the column type . And the value of that attribute could be, e.g. \"cat\" . These ORMs also have tools to make the connections or relations between tables or entities. This way, you could also have an attribute orion_cat.owner and the owner would contain the data for this pet's owner, taken from the table owners . So, orion_cat.owner.name could be the name (from the name column in the owners table) of this pet's owner. It could have a value like \"Arquilian\" . And the ORM will do all the work to get the information from the corresponding table owners when you try to access it from your pet object. Common ORMs are for example: Django-ORM (part of the Django framework), SQLAlchemy ORM (part of SQLAlchemy, independent of framework) and Peewee (independent of framework), among others.

But as what the API client provides is the original password, you need to extract it and generate the hashed password in your application. And then pass the hashed_password argument with the value to save. Warning This example is not secure, the password is not hashed. In a real life application you would need to hash the password and never save them in plaintext. For more details, go back to the Security section in the tutorial. Here we are focusing only on the tools and mechanics of databases. Tip Instead of passing each of the keyword arguments to Item and reading each one of them from the Pydantic model , we are generating a dict with the Pydantic model 's data with: item.dict() and then we are passing the dict 's key-value pairs as the keyword arguments to the SQLAlchemy Item , with: Item(**item.dict()) And then we pass the extra keyword argument owner_id that is not provided by the Pydantic model , with: Item(**item.dict(), owner_id=user_id)","title":"Create data"},{"location":"tutorial/sql-databases/#main-fastapi-app","text":"And now in the file sql_app/main.py let's integrate and use all the other parts we created before.","title":"Main FastAPI app"},{"location":"tutorial/sql-databases/#create-the-database-tables","text":"In a very simplistic way create the database tables: Python 3.6 and above Python 3.9 and above from typing import List from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI , HTTPException from sqlalchemy.orm import Session from . import crud , models , schemas from .database import SessionLocal , engine models .

Although it's probably not very problematic here with the way SQLAlchemy works. But if you added more code to the middleware that had a lot of I/O waiting, it could then be problematic. A middleware is run for every request. So, a connection will be created for every request. Even when the path operation that handles that request didn't need the DB.

Extended FastAPI app file \u00b6 Let's say that now the file main.py with your FastAPI app has some other path operations . It has a GET operation that could return an error.

Then you just do the same in your tests. E.g.: To pass a path or query parameter, add it to the URL itself. To pass a JSON body, pass a Python object (e.g. a dict ) to the parameter json . If you need to send Form Data instead of JSON, use the data parameter instead. To pass headers , use a dict in the headers parameter. For cookies , a dict in the cookies parameter. For more information about how to pass data to the backend (using requests or the TestClient ) check the Requests documentation . Info Note that the TestClient receives data that can be converted to JSON, not Pydantic models. If you have a Pydantic model in your test and you want to send its data to the application during testing, you can use the jsonable_encoder described in JSON Compatible Encoder .

If you need to send Form Data instead of JSON, use the data parameter instead. To pass headers , use a dict in the headers parameter. For cookies , a dict in the cookies parameter. For more information about how to pass data to the backend (using requests or the TestClient ) check the Requests documentation .

But you can help translating it: Contributing . FastAPI has a very powerful but intuitive Dependency Injection system. It is designed to be very simple to use, and to make it very easy for any developer to integrate other components with FastAPI . What is \"Dependency Injection\" \u00b6 \"Dependency Injection\" means, in programming, that there is a way for your code (in this case, your path operation functions ) to declare things that it requires to work and use: \"dependencies\". And then, that system (in this case FastAPI ) will take care of doing whatever is needed to provide your code with those needed dependencies (\"inject\" the dependencies). This is very useful when you need to: Have shared logic (the same code logic again and again). Share database connections. Enforce security, authentication, role requirements, etc. And many other things... All these, while minimizing code repetition. First Steps \u00b6 Let's see a very simple example. It will be so simple that it is not very useful, for now. But this way we can focus on how the Dependency Injection system works. Create a dependency, or \"dependable\" \u00b6 Let's first focus on the dependency. It is just a function that can take all the same parameters that a path operation function can take: Python 3.6 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Union from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI app = FastAPI () async def common_parameters ( q : Union [ str , None ] = None , skip : int = 0 , limit : int = 100 ): return { \"q\" : q , \"skip\" : skip , \"limit\" : limit } @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( commons : dict = Depends ( common_parameters )): return commons @app . get ( \"/users/\" ) async def read_users ( commons : dict = Depends ( common_parameters )): return commons from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI app = FastAPI () async def common_parameters ( q : str | None = None , skip : int = 0 , limit : int = 100 ): return { \"q\" : q , \"skip\" : skip , \"limit\" : limit } @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( commons : dict = Depends ( common_parameters )): return commons @app . get ( \"/users/\" ) async def read_users ( commons : dict = Depends ( common_parameters )): return commons That's it. 2 lines . And it has the same shape and structure that all your path operation functions have. You can think of it as a path operation function without the \"decorator\" (without the @app.get(\"/some-path\") ). And it can return anything you want. In this case, this dependency expects: An optional query parameter q that is a str . An optional query parameter skip that is an int , and by default is 0 . An optional query parameter limit that is an int , and by default is 100 . And then it just returns a dict containing those values. Import Depends \u00b6 Python 3.6 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Union from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI app = FastAPI () async def common_parameters ( q : Union [ str , None ] = None , skip : int = 0 , limit : int = 100 ): return { \"q\" : q , \"skip\" : skip , \"limit\" : limit } @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( commons : dict = Depends ( common_parameters )): return commons @app . get ( \"/users/\" ) async def read_users ( commons : dict = Depends ( common_parameters )): return commons from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI app = FastAPI () async def common_parameters ( q : str | None = None , skip : int = 0 , limit : int = 100 ): return { \"q\" : q , \"skip\" : skip , \"limit\" : limit } @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( commons : dict = Depends ( common_parameters )): return commons @app . get ( \"/users/\" ) async def read_users ( commons : dict = Depends ( common_parameters )): return commons Declare the dependency, in the \"dependant\" \u00b6 The same way you use Body , Query , etc. with your path operation function parameters, use Depends with a new parameter: Python 3.6 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Union from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI app = FastAPI () async def common_parameters ( q : Union [ str , None ] = None , skip : int = 0 , limit : int = 100 ): return { \"q\" : q , \"skip\" : skip , \"limit\" : limit } @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( commons : dict = Depends ( common_parameters )): return commons @app . get ( \"/users/\" ) async def read_users ( commons : dict = Depends ( common_parameters )): return commons from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI app = FastAPI () async def common_parameters ( q : str | None = None , skip : int = 0 , limit : int = 100 ): return { \"q\" : q , \"skip\" : skip , \"limit\" : limit } @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( commons : dict = Depends ( common_parameters )): return commons @app . get ( \"/users/\" ) async def read_users ( commons : dict = Depends ( common_parameters )): return commons Although you use Depends in the parameters of your function the same way you use Body , Query , etc, Depends works a bit differently. You only give Depends a single parameter. This parameter must be something like a function. And that function takes parameters in the same way that path operation functions do. Tip You'll see what other \"things\", apart from functions, can be used as dependencies in the next chapter. Whenever a new request arrives, FastAPI will take care of: Calling your dependency (\"dependable\") function with the correct parameters. Get the result from your function. Assign that result to the parameter in your path operation function . graph TB common_parameters([\"common_parameters\"]) read_items[\"/items/\"] read_users[\"/users/\"] common_parameters --> read_items common_parameters --> read_users This way you write shared code once and FastAPI takes care of calling it for your path operations . Check Notice that you don't have to create a special class and pass it somewhere to FastAPI to \"register\" it or anything similar. You just pass it to Depends and FastAPI knows how to do the rest. To async or not to async \u00b6 As dependencies will also be called by FastAPI (the same as your path operation functions ), the same rules apply while defining your functions. You can use async def or normal def . And you can declare dependencies with async def inside of normal def path operation functions , or def dependencies inside of async def path operation functions , etc. It doesn't matter. FastAPI will know what to do. Note If you don't know, check the Async: \"In a hurry?\" section about async and await in the docs. Integrated with OpenAPI \u00b6 All the request declarations, validations and requirements of your dependencies (and sub-dependencies) will be integrated in the same OpenAPI schema. So, the interactive docs will have all the information from these dependencies too: Simple usage \u00b6 If you look at it, path operation functions are declared to be used whenever a path and operation matches, and then FastAPI takes care of calling the function with the correct parameters, extracting the data from the request. Actually, all (or most) of the web frameworks work in this same way. You never call those functions directly. They are called by your framework (in this case, FastAPI ). With the Dependency Injection system, you can also tell FastAPI that your path operation function also \"depends\" on something else that should be executed before your path operation function , and FastAPI will take care of executing it and \"injecting\" the results. Other common terms for this same idea of \"dependency injection\" are: resources providers services injectables components FastAPI plug-ins \u00b6 Integrations and \"plug-in\"s can be built using the Dependency Injection system. But in fact, there is actually no need to create \"plug-ins\" , as by using dependencies it's possible to declare an infinite number of integrations and interactions that become available to your path operation functions . And dependencies can be created in a very simple and intuitive way that allow you to just import the Python packages you need, and integrate them with your API functions in a couple of lines of code, literally . You will see examples of this in the next chapters, about relational and NoSQL databases, security, etc. FastAPI compatibility \u00b6 The simplicity of the dependency injection system makes FastAPI compatible with: all the relational databases NoSQL databases external packages external APIs authentication and authorization systems API usage monitoring systems response data injection systems etc. Simple and Powerful \u00b6 Although the hierarchical dependency injection system is very simple to define and use, it's still very powerful. You can define dependencies that in turn can define dependencies themselves. In the end, a hierarchical tree of dependencies is built, and the Dependency Injection system takes care of solving all these dependencies for you (and their sub-dependencies) and providing (injecting) the results at each step. For example, let's say you have 4 API endpoints ( path operations ): /items/public/ /items/private/ /users/{user_id}/activate /items/pro/ then you could add different permission requirements for each of them just with dependencies and sub-dependencies: graph TB current_user([\"current_user\"]) active_user([\"active_user\"]) admin_user([\"admin_user\"]) paying_user([\"paying_user\"]) public[\"/items/public/\"] private[\"/items/private/\"] activate_user[\"/users/{user_id}/activate\"] pro_items[\"/items/pro/\"] current_user --> active_user active_user --> admin_user active_user --> paying_user current_user --> public active_user --> private admin_user --> activate_user paying_user --> pro_items Integrated with OpenAPI \u00b6 All these dependencies, while declaring their requirements, also add parameters, validations, etc. to your path operations .

But you can help translating it: Contributing . Before diving deeper into the Dependency Injection system, let's upgrade the previous example. A dict from the previous example \u00b6 In the previous example, we were returning a dict from our dependency (\"dependable\"): Python 3.6 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Union from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI app = FastAPI () async def common_parameters ( q : Union [ str , None ] = None , skip : int = 0 , limit : int = 100 ): return { \"q\" : q , \"skip\" : skip , \"limit\" : limit } @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( commons : dict = Depends ( common_parameters )): return commons @app . get ( \"/users/\" ) async def read_users ( commons : dict = Depends ( common_parameters )): return commons from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI app = FastAPI () async def common_parameters ( q : str | None = None , skip : int = 0 , limit : int = 100 ): return { \"q\" : q , \"skip\" : skip , \"limit\" : limit } @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( commons : dict = Depends ( common_parameters )): return commons @app . get ( \"/users/\" ) async def read_users ( commons : dict = Depends ( common_parameters )): return commons But then we get a dict in the parameter commons of the path operation function . And we know that editors can't provide a lot of support (like completion) for dict s, because they can't know their keys and value types. We can do better... What makes a dependency \u00b6 Up to now you have seen dependencies declared as functions. But that's not the only way to declare dependencies (although it would probably be the more common). The key factor is that a dependency should be a \"callable\". A \" callable \" in Python is anything that Python can \"call\" like a function. So, if you have an object something (that might not be a function) and you can \"call\" it (execute it) like: something () or something ( some_argument , some_keyword_argument = \"foo\" ) then it is a \"callable\". Classes as dependencies \u00b6 You might notice that to create an instance of a Python class, you use that same syntax. For example: class Cat : def __init__ ( self , name : str ): self . name = name fluffy = Cat ( name = \"Mr Fluffy\" ) In this case, fluffy is an instance of the class Cat . And to create fluffy , you are \"calling\" Cat . So, a Python class is also a callable . Then, in FastAPI , you could use a Python class as a dependency. What FastAPI actually checks is that it is a \"callable\" (function, class or anything else) and the parameters defined. If you pass a \"callable\" as a dependency in FastAPI , it will analyze the parameters for that \"callable\", and process them in the same way as the parameters for a path operation function .

But you can help translating it: Contributing . FastAPI supports dependencies that do some extra steps after finishing . To do this, use yield instead of return , and write the extra steps after. Tip Make sure to use yield one single time. Technical Details Any function that is valid to use with: @contextlib.contextmanager or @contextlib.asynccontextmanager would be valid to use as a FastAPI dependency. In fact, FastAPI uses those two decorators internally. A database dependency with yield \u00b6 For example, you could use this to create a database session and close it after finishing. Only the code prior to and including the yield statement is executed before sending a response: async def get_db (): db = DBSession () try : yield db finally : db . close () The yielded value is what is injected into path operations and other dependencies: async def get_db (): db = DBSession () try : yield db finally : db . close () The code following the yield statement is executed after the response has been delivered: async def get_db (): db = DBSession () try : yield db finally : db . close () Tip You can use async or normal functions. FastAPI will do the right thing with each, the same as with normal dependencies. A dependency with yield and try \u00b6 If you use a try block in a dependency with yield , you'll receive any exception that was thrown when using the dependency. For example, if some code at some point in the middle, in another dependency or in a path operation , made a database transaction \"rollback\" or create any other error, you will receive the exception in your dependency. So, you can look for that specific exception inside the dependency with except SomeException . In the same way, you can use finally to make sure the exit steps are executed, no matter if there was an exception or not. async def get_db (): db = DBSession () try : yield db finally : db . close () Sub-dependencies with yield \u00b6 You can have sub-dependencies and \"trees\" of sub-dependencies of any size and shape, and any or all of them can use yield . FastAPI will make sure that the \"exit code\" in each dependency with yield is run in the correct order. For example, dependency_c can have a dependency on dependency_b , and dependency_b on dependency_a : from fastapi import Depends async def dependency_a (): dep_a = generate_dep_a () try : yield dep_a finally : dep_a . close () async def dependency_b ( dep_a = Depends ( dependency_a )): dep_b = generate_dep_b () try : yield dep_b finally : dep_b . close ( dep_a ) async def dependency_c ( dep_b = Depends ( dependency_b )): dep_c = generate_dep_c () try : yield dep_c finally : dep_c . close ( dep_b ) And all of them can use yield . In this case dependency_c , to execute its exit code, needs the value from dependency_b (here named dep_b ) to still be available. And, in turn, dependency_b needs the value from dependency_a (here named dep_a ) to be available for its exit code. from fastapi import Depends async def dependency_a (): dep_a = generate_dep_a () try : yield dep_a finally : dep_a . close () async def dependency_b ( dep_a = Depends ( dependency_a )): dep_b = generate_dep_b () try : yield dep_b finally : dep_b . close ( dep_a ) async def dependency_c ( dep_b = Depends ( dependency_b )): dep_c = generate_dep_c () try : yield dep_c finally : dep_c . close ( dep_b ) The same way, you could have dependencies with yield and return mixed. And you could have a single dependency that requires several other dependencies with yield , etc. You can have any combinations of dependencies that you want. FastAPI will make sure everything is run in the correct order. Technical Details This works thanks to Python's Context Managers . FastAPI uses them internally to achieve this. Dependencies with yield and HTTPException \u00b6 You saw that you can use dependencies with yield and have try blocks that catch exceptions. It might be tempting to raise an HTTPException or similar in the exit code, after the yield . But it won't work . The exit code in dependencies with yield is executed after the response is sent, so Exception Handlers will have already run. There's nothing catching exceptions thrown by your dependencies in the exit code (after the yield ). So, if you raise an HTTPException after the yield , the default (or any custom) exception handler that catches HTTPException s and returns an HTTP 400 response won't be there to catch that exception anymore. This is what allows anything set in the dependency (e.g. a DB session) to, for example, be used by background tasks. Background tasks are run after the response has been sent. So there's no way to raise an HTTPException because there's not even a way to change the response that is already sent . But if a background task creates a DB error, at least you can rollback or cleanly close the session in the dependency with yield , and maybe log the error or report it to a remote tracking system. If you have some code that you know could raise an exception, do the most normal/\"Pythonic\" thing and add a try block in that section of the code. If you have custom exceptions that you would like to handle before returning the response and possibly modifying the response, maybe even raising an HTTPException , create a Custom Exception Handler . Tip You can still raise exceptions including HTTPException before the yield . But not after. The sequence of execution is more or less like this diagram. Time flows from top to bottom. And each column is one of the parts interacting or executing code. sequenceDiagram participant client as Client participant handler as Exception handler participant dep as Dep with yield participant operation as Path Operation participant tasks as Background tasks Note over client,tasks: Can raise exception for dependency, handled after response is sent Note over client,operation: Can raise HTTPException and can change the response client ->> dep: Start request Note over dep: Run code up to yield opt raise dep -->> handler: Raise HTTPException handler -->> client: HTTP error response dep -->> dep: Raise other exception end dep ->> operation: Run dependency, e.g. DB session opt raise operation -->> dep: Raise HTTPException dep -->> handler: Auto forward exception handler -->> client: HTTP error response operation -->> dep: Raise other exception dep -->> handler: Auto forward exception end operation ->> client: Return response to client Note over client,operation: Response is already sent, can't change it anymore opt Tasks operation -->> tasks: Send background tasks end opt Raise other exception tasks -->> dep: Raise other exception end Note over dep: After yield opt Handle other exception dep -->> dep: Handle exception, can't change response. E.g. close DB session. end Info Only one response will be sent to the client. It might be one of the error responses or it will be the response from the path operation . After one of those responses is sent, no other response can be sent. Tip This diagram shows HTTPException , but you could also raise any other exception for which you create a Custom Exception Handler . If you raise any exception, it will be passed to the dependencies with yield, including HTTPException , and then again to the exception handlers. If there's no exception handler for that exception, it will then be handled by the default internal ServerErrorMiddleware , returning a 500 HTTP status code, to let the client know that there was an error in the server. Context Managers \u00b6 What are \"Context Managers\" \u00b6 \"Context Managers\" are any of those Python objects that you can use in a with statement. For example, you can use with to read a file : with open ( \"./somefile.txt\" ) as f : contents = f . read () print ( contents ) Underneath, the open(\"./somefile.txt\") creates an object that is a called a \"Context Manager\". When the with block finishes, it makes sure to close the file, even if there were exceptions. When you create a dependency with yield , FastAPI will internally convert it to a context manager, and combine it with some other related tools. Using context managers in dependencies with yield \u00b6 Warning This is, more or less, an \"advanced\" idea. If you are just starting with FastAPI you might want to skip it for now. In Python, you can create Context Managers by creating a class with two methods: __enter__() and __exit__() . You can also use them inside of FastAPI dependencies with yield by using with or async with statements inside of the dependency function: class MySuperContextManager : def __init__ ( self ): self . db = DBSession () def __enter__ ( self ): return self . db def __exit__ ( self , exc_type , exc_value , traceback ): self . db . close () async def get_db (): with MySuperContextManager () as db : yield db Tip Another way to create a context manager is with: @contextlib.contextmanager or @contextlib.asynccontextmanager using them to decorate a function with a single yield .

But you can help translating it: Contributing . You can create dependencies that have sub-dependencies . They can be as deep as you need them to be. FastAPI will take care of solving them. First dependency \"dependable\" \u00b6 You could create a first dependency (\"dependable\") like: Python 3.6 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Union from fastapi import Cookie , Depends , FastAPI app = FastAPI () def query_extractor ( q : Union [ str , None ] = None ): return q def query_or_cookie_extractor ( q : str = Depends ( query_extractor ), last_query : Union [ str , None ] = Cookie ( default = None ), ): if not q : return last_query return q @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_query ( query_or_default : str = Depends ( query_or_cookie_extractor )): return { \"q_or_cookie\" : query_or_default } from fastapi import Cookie , Depends , FastAPI app = FastAPI () def query_extractor ( q : str | None = None ): return q def query_or_cookie_extractor ( q : str = Depends ( query_extractor ), last_query : str | None = Cookie ( default = None ) ): if not q : return last_query return q @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_query ( query_or_default : str = Depends ( query_or_cookie_extractor )): return { \"q_or_cookie\" : query_or_default } It declares an optional query parameter q as a str , and then it just returns it. This is quite simple (not very useful), but will help us focus on how the sub-dependencies work. Second dependency, \"dependable\" and \"dependant\" \u00b6 Then you can create another dependency function (a \"dependable\") that at the same time declares a dependency of its own (so it is a \"dependant\" too): Python 3.6 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Union from fastapi import Cookie , Depends , FastAPI app = FastAPI () def query_extractor ( q : Union [ str , None ] = None ): return q def query_or_cookie_extractor ( q : str = Depends ( query_extractor ), last_query : Union [ str , None ] = Cookie ( default = None ), ): if not q : return last_query return q @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_query ( query_or_default : str = Depends ( query_or_cookie_extractor )): return { \"q_or_cookie\" : query_or_default } from fastapi import Cookie , Depends , FastAPI app = FastAPI () def query_extractor ( q : str | None = None ): return q def query_or_cookie_extractor ( q : str = Depends ( query_extractor ), last_query : str | None = Cookie ( default = None ) ): if not q : return last_query return q @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_query ( query_or_default : str = Depends ( query_or_cookie_extractor )): return { \"q_or_cookie\" : query_or_default } Let's focus on the parameters declared: Even though this function is a dependency (\"dependable\") itself, it also declares another dependency (it \"depends\" on something else). It depends on the query_extractor , and assigns the value returned by it to the parameter q . It also declares an optional last_query cookie, as a str . If the user didn't provide any query q , we use the last query used, which we saved to a cookie before. Use the dependency \u00b6 Then we can use the dependency with: Python 3.6 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Union from fastapi import Cookie , Depends , FastAPI app = FastAPI () def query_extractor ( q : Union [ str , None ] = None ): return q def query_or_cookie_extractor ( q : str = Depends ( query_extractor ), last_query : Union [ str , None ] = Cookie ( default = None ), ): if not q : return last_query return q @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_query ( query_or_default : str = Depends ( query_or_cookie_extractor )): return { \"q_or_cookie\" : query_or_default } from fastapi import Cookie , Depends , FastAPI app = FastAPI () def query_extractor ( q : str | None = None ): return q def query_or_cookie_extractor ( q : str = Depends ( query_extractor ), last_query : str | None = Cookie ( default = None ) ): if not q : return last_query return q @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_query ( query_or_default : str = Depends ( query_or_cookie_extractor )): return { \"q_or_cookie\" : query_or_default } Info Notice that we are only declaring one dependency in the path operation function , the query_or_cookie_extractor . But FastAPI will know that it has to solve query_extractor first, to pass the results of that to query_or_cookie_extractor while calling it. graph TB query_extractor([\"query_extractor\"]) query_or_cookie_extractor([\"query_or_cookie_extractor\"]) read_query[\"/items/\"] query_extractor --> query_or_cookie_extractor --> read_query Using the same dependency multiple times \u00b6 If one of your dependencies is declared multiple times for the same path operation , for example, multiple dependencies have a common sub-dependency, FastAPI will know to call that sub-dependency only once per request. And it will save the returned value in a \"cache\" and pass it to all the \"dependants\" that need it in that specific request, instead of calling the dependency multiple times for the same request.

FastAPI provides several tools to help you deal with Security easily, rapidly, in a standard way, without having to study and learn all the security specifications. But first, let's check some small concepts. In a hurry? \u00b6 If you don't care about any of these terms and you just need to add security with authentication based on username and password right now , skip to the next chapters. OAuth2 \u00b6 OAuth2 is a specification that defines several ways to handle authentication and authorization. It is quite an extensive specification and covers several complex use cases. It includes ways to authenticate using a \"third party\". That's what all the systems with \"login with Facebook, Google, Twitter, GitHub\" use underneath. OAuth 1 \u00b6 There was an OAuth 1, which is very different from OAuth2, and more complex, as it included directly specifications on how to encrypt the communication. It is not very popular or used nowadays. OAuth2 doesn't specify how to encrypt the communication, it expects you to have your application served with HTTPS. Tip In the section about deployment you will see how to set up HTTPS for free, using Traefik and Let's Encrypt. OpenID Connect \u00b6 OpenID Connect is another specification, based on OAuth2 . It just extends OAuth2 specifying some things that are relatively ambiguous in OAuth2, to try to make it more interoperable. For example, Google login uses OpenID Connect (which underneath uses OAuth2). But Facebook login doesn't support OpenID Connect. It has its own flavor of OAuth2. OpenID (not \"OpenID Connect\") \u00b6 There was also an \"OpenID\" specification. That tried to solve the same thing as OpenID Connect , but was not based on OAuth2. So, it was a complete additional system. It is not very popular or used nowadays. OpenAPI \u00b6 OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) is the open specification for building APIs (now part of the Linux Foundation). FastAPI is based on OpenAPI . That's what makes it possible to have multiple automatic interactive documentation interfaces, code generation, etc. OpenAPI has a way to define multiple security \"schemes\". By using them, you can take advantage of all these standard-based tools, including these interactive documentation systems. OpenAPI defines the following security schemes: apiKey : an application specific key that can come from: A query parameter. A header. A cookie. http : standard HTTP authentication systems, including: bearer : a header Authorization with a value of Bearer plus a token. This is inherited from OAuth2. HTTP Basic authentication. HTTP Digest, etc. oauth2 : all the OAuth2 ways to handle security (called \"flows\"). Several of these flows are appropriate for building an OAuth 2.0 authentication provider (like Google, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, etc): implicit clientCredentials authorizationCode But there is one specific \"flow\" that can be perfectly used for handling authentication in the same application directly: password : some next chapters will cover examples of this. openIdConnect : has a way to define how to discover OAuth2 authentication data automatically. This automatic discovery is what is defined in the OpenID Connect specification. Tip Integrating other authentication/authorization providers like Google, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, etc. is also possible and relatively easy. The most complex problem is building an authentication/authorization provider like those, but FastAPI gives you the tools to do it easily, while doing the heavy lifting for you.

But you can help translating it: Contributing . Let's imagine that you have your backend API in some domain. And you have a frontend in another domain or in a different path of the same domain (or in a mobile application). And you want to have a way for the frontend to authenticate with the backend, using a username and password . We can use OAuth2 to build that with FastAPI . But let's save you the time of reading the full long specification just to find those little pieces of information you need. Let's use the tools provided by FastAPI to handle security. How it looks \u00b6 Let's first just use the code and see how it works, and then we'll come back to understand what's happening. Create main.py \u00b6 Copy the example in a file main.py : from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer app = FastAPI () oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer ( tokenUrl = \"token\" ) @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( token : str = Depends ( oauth2_scheme )): return { \"token\" : token } Run it \u00b6 Info First install python-multipart .

You will see something like this: Authorize button! You already have a shiny new \"Authorize\" button. And your path operation has a little lock in the top-right corner that you can click. And if you click it, you have a little authorization form to type a username and password (and other optional fields): Note It doesn't matter what you type in the form, it won't work yet. But we'll get there. This is of course not the frontend for the final users, but it's a great automatic tool to document interactively all your API. It can be used by the frontend team (that can also be yourself). It can be used by third party applications and systems. And it can also be used by yourself, to debug, check and test the same application. The password flow \u00b6 Now let's go back a bit and understand what is all that. The password \"flow\" is one of the ways (\"flows\") defined in OAuth2, to handle security and authentication. OAuth2 was designed so that the backend or API could be independent of the server that authenticates the user. But in this case, the same FastAPI application will handle the API and the authentication. So, let's review it from that simplified point of view: The user types the username and password in the frontend, and hits Enter . The frontend (running in the user's browser) sends that username and password to a specific URL in our API (declared with tokenUrl=\"token\" ). The API checks that username and password , and responds with a \"token\" (we haven't implemented any of this yet). A \"token\" is just a string with some content that we can use later to verify this user. Normally, a token is set to expire after some time. So, the user will have to log in again at some point later. And if the token is stolen, the risk is less. It is not like a permanent key that will work forever (in most of the cases). The frontend stores that token temporarily somewhere. The user clicks in the frontend to go to another section of the frontend web app. The frontend needs to fetch some more data from the API. But it needs authentication for that specific endpoint. So, to authenticate with our API, it sends a header Authorization with a value of Bearer plus the token. If the token contains foobar , the content of the Authorization header would be: Bearer foobar . FastAPI 's OAuth2PasswordBearer \u00b6 FastAPI provides several tools, at different levels of abstraction, to implement these security features. In this example we are going to use OAuth2 , with the Password flow, using a Bearer token. We do that using the OAuth2PasswordBearer class. Info A \"bearer\" token is not the only option. But it's the best one for our use case. And it might be the best for most use cases, unless you are an OAuth2 expert and know exactly why there's another option that suits better your needs. In that case, FastAPI also provides you with the tools to build it. When we create an instance of the OAuth2PasswordBearer class we pass in the tokenUrl parameter. This parameter contains the URL that the client (the frontend running in the user's browser) will use to send the username and password in order to get a token. from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer app = FastAPI () oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer ( tokenUrl = \"token\" ) @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( token : str = Depends ( oauth2_scheme )): return { \"token\" : token } Tip Here tokenUrl=\"token\" refers to a relative URL token that we haven't created yet. As it's a relative URL, it's equivalent to ./token . Because we are using a relative URL, if your API was located at https://example.com/ , then it would refer to https://example.com/token . But if your API was located at https://example.com/api/v1/ , then it would refer to https://example.com/api/v1/token . Using a relative URL is important to make sure your application keeps working even in an advanced use case like Behind a Proxy . This parameter doesn't create that endpoint / path operation , but declares that the URL /token will be the one that the client should use to get the token. That information is used in OpenAPI, and then in the interactive API documentation systems. We will soon also create the actual path operation. Info If you are a very strict \"Pythonista\" you might dislike the style of the parameter name tokenUrl instead of token_url . That's because it is using the same name as in the OpenAPI spec. So that if you need to investigate more about any of these security schemes you can just copy and paste it to find more information about it. The oauth2_scheme variable is an instance of OAuth2PasswordBearer , but it is also a \"callable\". It could be called as: oauth2_scheme ( some , parameters ) So, it can be used with Depends . Use it \u00b6 Now you can pass that oauth2_scheme in a dependency with Depends . from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer app = FastAPI () oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer ( tokenUrl = \"token\" ) @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( token : str = Depends ( oauth2_scheme )): return { \"token\" : token } This dependency will provide a str that is assigned to the parameter token of the path operation function . FastAPI will know that it can use this dependency to define a \"security scheme\" in the OpenAPI schema (and the automatic API docs). Technical Details FastAPI will know that it can use the class OAuth2PasswordBearer (declared in a dependency) to define the security scheme in OpenAPI because it inherits from fastapi.security.oauth2.OAuth2 , which in turn inherits from fastapi.security.base.SecurityBase . All the security utilities that integrate with OpenAPI (and the automatic API docs) inherit from SecurityBase , that's how FastAPI can know how to integrate them in OpenAPI. What it does \u00b6 It will go and look in the request for that Authorization header, check if the value is Bearer plus some token, and will return the token as a str . If it doesn't see an Authorization header, or the value doesn't have a Bearer token, it will respond with a 401 status code error ( UNAUTHORIZED ) directly. You don't even have to check if the token exists to return an error. You can be sure that if your function is executed, it will have a str in that token. You can try it already in the interactive docs: We are not verifying the validity of the token yet, but that's a start already.

And you can use any model or data for the security requirements (in this case, a Pydantic model User ). But you are not restricted to using some specific data model, class or type. Do you want to have an id and email and not have any username in your model? Sure. You can use these same tools. Do you want to just have a str ? Or just a dict ? Or a database class model instance directly? It all works the same way. You actually don't have users that log in to your application but robots, bots, or other systems, that have just an access token? Again, it all works the same. Just use any kind of model, any kind of class, any kind of database that you need for your application. FastAPI has you covered with the dependency injection system.

But you can help translating it: Contributing . Now that we have all the security flow, let's make the application actually secure, using JWT tokens and secure password hashing. This code is something you can actually use in your application, save the password hashes in your database, etc. We are going to start from where we left in the previous chapter and increment it. About JWT \u00b6 JWT means \"JSON Web Tokens\". It's a standard to codify a JSON object in a long dense string without spaces. It looks like this: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c It is not encrypted, so, anyone could recover the information from the contents. But it's signed. So, when you receive a token that you emitted, you can verify that you actually emitted it. That way, you can create a token with an expiration of, let's say, 1 week. And then when the user comes back the next day with the token, you know that user is still logged in to your system. After a week, the token will be expired and the user will not be authorized and will have to sign in again to get a new token. And if the user (or a third party) tried to modify the token to change the expiration, you would be able to discover it, because the signatures would not match. If you want to play with JWT tokens and see how they work, check https://jwt.io . Install python-jose \u00b6 We need to install python-jose to generate and verify the JWT tokens in Python: $ pip install \"python-jose[cryptography]\" ---> 100% Python-jose requires a cryptographic backend as an extra. Here we are using the recommended one: pyca/cryptography . Tip This tutorial previously used PyJWT . But it was updated to use Python-jose instead as it provides all the features from PyJWT plus some extras that you might need later when building integrations with other tools. Password hashing \u00b6 \"Hashing\" means converting some content (a password in this case) into a sequence of bytes (just a string) that looks like gibberish. Whenever you pass exactly the same content (exactly the same password) you get exactly the same gibberish. But you cannot convert from the gibberish back to the password. Why use password hashing \u00b6 If your database is stolen, the thief won't have your users' plaintext passwords, only the hashes. So, the thief won't be able to try to use that password in another system (as many users use the same password everywhere, this would be dangerous). Install passlib \u00b6 PassLib is a great Python package to handle password hashes. It supports many secure hashing algorithms and utilities to work with them. The recommended algorithm is \"Bcrypt\". So, install PassLib with Bcrypt: $ pip install \"passlib[bcrypt]\" ---> 100% Tip With passlib , you could even configure it to be able to read passwords created by Django , a Flask security plug-in or many others. So, you would be able to, for example, share the same data from a Django application in a database with a FastAPI application. Or gradually migrate a Django application using the same database. And your users would be able to login from your Django app or from your FastAPI app, at the same time. Hash and verify the passwords \u00b6 Import the tools we need from passlib . Create a PassLib \"context\". This is what will be used to hash and verify passwords. Tip The PassLib context also has functionality to use different hashing algorithms, including deprecated old ones only to allow verifying them, etc. For example, you could use it to read and verify passwords generated by another system (like Django) but hash any new passwords with a different algorithm like Bcrypt. And be compatible with all of them at the same time. Create a utility function to hash a password coming from the user. And another utility to verify if a received password matches the hash stored.

Handle JWT tokens \u00b6 Import the modules installed. Create a random secret key that will be used to sign the JWT tokens. To generate a secure random secret key use the command: $ openssl rand -hex 32 09d25e094faa6ca2556c818166b7a9563b93f7099f6f0f4caa6cf63b88e8d3e7 And copy the output to the variable SECRET_KEY (don't use the one in the example). Create a variable ALGORITHM with the algorithm used to sign the JWT token and set it to \"HS256\" . Create a variable for the expiration of the token. Define a Pydantic Model that will be used in the token endpoint for the response. Create a utility function to generate a new access token.

It's optional to use it, but that's where you would put the user's identification, so we are using it here. JWT might be used for other things apart from identifying a user and allowing them to perform operations directly on your API. For example, you could identify a \"car\" or a \"blog post\". Then you could add permissions about that entity, like \"drive\" (for the car) or \"edit\" (for the blog). And then, you could give that JWT token to a user (or bot), and they could use it to perform those actions (drive the car, or edit the blog post) without even needing to have an account, just with the JWT token your API generated for that. Using these ideas, JWT can be used for way more sophisticated scenarios. In those cases, several of those entities could have the same ID, let's say foo (a user foo , a car foo , and a blog post foo ). So, to avoid ID collisions, when creating the JWT token for the user, you could prefix the value of the sub key, e.g. with username: . So, in this example, the value of sub could have been: username:johndoe . The important thing to have in mind is that the sub key should have a unique identifier across the entire application, and it should be a string. Check it \u00b6 Run the server and go to the docs: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs . You'll see the user interface like: Authorize the application the same way as before. Using the credentials: Username: johndoe Password: secret Check Notice that nowhere in the code is the plaintext password \" secret \", we only have the hashed version. Call the endpoint /users/me/ , you will get the response as: { \"username\" : \"johndoe\" , \"email\" : \"johndoe@example.com\" , \"full_name\" : \"John Doe\" , \"disabled\" : false } If you open the developer tools, you could see how the data sent and only includes the token, the password is only sent in the first request to authenticate the user and get that access token, but not afterwards: Note Notice the header Authorization , with a value that starts with Bearer . Advanced usage with scopes \u00b6 OAuth2 has the notion of \"scopes\". You can use them to add a specific set of permissions to a JWT token. Then you can give this token to a user directly or a third party, to interact with your API with a set of restrictions. You can learn how to use them and how they are integrated into FastAPI later in the Advanced User Guide . Recap \u00b6 With what you have seen up to now, you can set up a secure FastAPI application using standards like OAuth2 and JWT. In almost any framework handling the security becomes a rather complex subject quite quickly. Many packages that simplify it a lot have to make many compromises with the data model, database, and available features. And some of these packages that simplify things too much actually have security flaws underneath. FastAPI doesn't make any compromise with any database, data model or tool. It gives you all the flexibility to choose the ones that fit your project the best. And you can use directly many well maintained and widely used packages like passlib and python-jose , because FastAPI doesn't require any complex mechanisms to integrate external packages. But it provides you the tools to simplify the process as much as possible without compromising flexibility, robustness, or security. And you can use and implement secure, standard protocols, like OAuth2 in a relatively simple way. You can learn more in the Advanced User Guide about how to use OAuth2 \"scopes\", for a more fine-grained permission system, following these same standards. OAuth2 with scopes is the mechanism used by many big authentication providers, like Facebook, Google, GitHub, Microsoft, Twitter, etc. to authorize third party applications to interact with their APIs on behalf of their users.","title":"OAuth2 with Password (and hashing), Bearer with JWT tokens"},{"location":"tutorial/security/oauth2-jwt/#oauth2-with-password-and-hashing-bearer-with-jwt-tokens","text":"Warning The current page still doesn't have a translation for this language.

But it's signed. So, when you receive a token that you emitted, you can verify that you actually emitted it. That way, you can create a token with an expiration of, let's say, 1 week. And then when the user comes back the next day with the token, you know that user is still logged in to your system. After a week, the token will be expired and the user will not be authorized and will have to sign in again to get a new token. And if the user (or a third party) tried to modify the token to change the expiration, you would be able to discover it, because the signatures would not match.

So, you would be able to, for example, share the same data from a Django application in a database with a FastAPI application. Or gradually migrate a Django application using the same database.

And be compatible with all of them at the same time. Create a utility function to hash a password coming from the user. And another utility to verify if a received password matches the hash stored. And another one to authenticate and return a user.

It's optional to use it, but that's where you would put the user's identification, so we are using it here. JWT might be used for other things apart from identifying a user and allowing them to perform operations directly on your API. For example, you could identify a \"car\" or a \"blog post\". Then you could add permissions about that entity, like \"drive\" (for the car) or \"edit\" (for the blog). And then, you could give that JWT token to a user (or bot), and they could use it to perform those actions (drive the car, or edit the blog post) without even needing to have an account, just with the JWT token your API generated for that. Using these ideas, JWT can be used for way more sophisticated scenarios. In those cases, several of those entities could have the same ID, let's say foo (a user foo , a car foo , and a blog post foo ). So, to avoid ID collisions, when creating the JWT token for the user, you could prefix the value of the sub key, e.g. with username: . So, in this example, the value of sub could have been: username:johndoe . The important thing to have in mind is that the sub key should have a unique identifier across the entire application, and it should be a string.","title":"Technical details about the JWT \"subject\" sub"},{"location":"tutorial/security/oauth2-jwt/#check-it","text":"Run the server and go to the docs: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs .

In almost any framework handling the security becomes a rather complex subject quite quickly.

And some of these packages that simplify things too much actually have security flaws underneath. FastAPI doesn't make any compromise with any database, data model or tool. It gives you all the flexibility to choose the ones that fit your project the best. And you can use directly many well maintained and widely used packages like passlib and python-jose , because FastAPI doesn't require any complex mechanisms to integrate external packages. But it provides you the tools to simplify the process as much as possible without compromising flexibility, robustness, or security. And you can use and implement secure, standard protocols, like OAuth2 in a relatively simple way. You can learn more in the Advanced User Guide about how to use OAuth2 \"scopes\", for a more fine-grained permission system, following these same standards.

But for the login path operation , we need to use these names to be compatible with the spec (and be able to, for example, use the integrated API documentation system). The spec also states that the username and password must be sent as form data (so, no JSON here). scope \u00b6 The spec also says that the client can send another form field \" scope \". The form field name is scope (in singular), but it is actually a long string with \"scopes\" separated by spaces. Each \"scope\" is just a string (without spaces). They are normally used to declare specific security permissions, for example: users:read or users:write are common examples. instagram_basic is used by Facebook / Instagram. https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive is used by Google. Info In OAuth2 a \"scope\" is just a string that declares a specific permission required. It doesn't matter if it has other characters like : or if it is a URL. Those details are implementation specific. For OAuth2 they are just strings. Code to get the username and password \u00b6 Now let's use the utilities provided by FastAPI to handle this. OAuth2PasswordRequestForm \u00b6 First, import OAuth2PasswordRequestForm , and use it as a dependency with Depends in the path operation for /token : Python 3.6 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Union from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI , HTTPException , status from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer , OAuth2PasswordRequestForm from pydantic import BaseModel fake_users_db = { \"johndoe\" : { \"username\" : \"johndoe\" , \"full_name\" : \"John Doe\" , \"email\" : \"johndoe@example.com\" , \"hashed_password\" : \"fakehashedsecret\" , \"disabled\" : False , }, \"alice\" : { \"username\" : \"alice\" , \"full_name\" : \"Alice Wonderson\" , \"email\" : \"alice@example.com\" , \"hashed_password\" : \"fakehashedsecret2\" , \"disabled\" : True , }, } app = FastAPI () def fake_hash_password ( password : str ): return \"fakehashed\" + password oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer ( tokenUrl = \"token\" ) class User ( BaseModel ): username : str email : Union [ str , None ] = None full_name : Union [ str , None ] = None disabled : Union [ bool , None ] = None class UserInDB ( User ): hashed_password : str def get_user ( db , username : str ): if username in db : user_dict = db [ username ] return UserInDB ( ** user_dict ) def fake_decode_token ( token ): # This doesn't provide any security at all # Check the next version user = get_user ( fake_users_db , token ) return user async def get_current_user ( token : str = Depends ( oauth2_scheme )): user = fake_decode_token ( token ) if not user : raise HTTPException ( status_code = status .

The password . An optional scope field as a big string, composed of strings separated by spaces. An optional grant_type . Tip The OAuth2 spec actually requires a field grant_type with a fixed value of password , but OAuth2PasswordRequestForm doesn't enforce it. If you need to enforce it, use OAuth2PasswordRequestFormStrict instead of OAuth2PasswordRequestForm . An optional client_id (we don't need it for our example). An optional client_secret (we don't need it for our example). Info The OAuth2PasswordRequestForm is not a special class for FastAPI as is OAuth2PasswordBearer . OAuth2PasswordBearer makes FastAPI know that it is a security scheme. So it is added that way to OpenAPI. But OAuth2PasswordRequestForm is just a class dependency that you could have written yourself, or you could have declared Form parameters directly. But as it's a common use case, it is provided by FastAPI directly, just to make it easier. Use the form data \u00b6 Tip The instance of the dependency class OAuth2PasswordRequestForm won't have an attribute scope with the long string separated by spaces, instead, it will have a scopes attribute with the actual list of strings for each scope sent. We are not using scopes in this example, but the functionality is there if you need it. Now, get the user data from the (fake) database, using the username from the form field. If there is no such user, we return an error saying \"incorrect username or password\". For the error, we use the exception HTTPException : Python 3.6 and above Python 3.10 and above from typing import Union from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI , HTTPException , status from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer , OAuth2PasswordRequestForm from pydantic import BaseModel fake_users_db = { \"johndoe\" : { \"username\" : \"johndoe\" , \"full_name\" : \"John Doe\" , \"email\" : \"johndoe@example.com\" , \"hashed_password\" : \"fakehashedsecret\" , \"disabled\" : False , }, \"alice\" : { \"username\" : \"alice\" , \"full_name\" : \"Alice Wonderson\" , \"email\" : \"alice@example.com\" , \"hashed_password\" : \"fakehashedsecret2\" , \"disabled\" : True , }, } app = FastAPI () def fake_hash_password ( password : str ): return \"fakehashed\" + password oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer ( tokenUrl = \"token\" ) class User ( BaseModel ): username : str email : Union [ str , None ] = None full_name : Union [ str , None ] = None disabled : Union [ bool , None ] = None class UserInDB ( User ): hashed_password : str def get_user ( db , username : str ): if username in db : user_dict = db [ username ] return UserInDB ( ** user_dict ) def fake_decode_token ( token ): # This doesn't provide any security at all # Check the next version user = get_user ( fake_users_db , token ) return user async def get_current_user ( token : str = Depends ( oauth2_scheme )): user = fake_decode_token ( token ) if not user : raise HTTPException ( status_code = status .

Let's put that data in the Pydantic UserInDB model first. You should never save plaintext passwords, so, we'll use the (fake) password hashing system. If the passwords don't match, we return the same error. Password hashing \u00b6 \"Hashing\" means: converting some content (a password in this case) into a sequence of bytes (just a string) that looks like gibberish. Whenever you pass exactly the same content (exactly the same password) you get exactly the same gibberish. But you cannot convert from the gibberish back to the password. Why use password hashing \u00b6 If your database is stolen, the thief won't have your users' plaintext passwords, only the hashes. So, the thief won't be able to try to use those same passwords in another system (as many users use the same password everywhere, this would be dangerous).

And it should have an access_token , with a string containing our access token. For this simple example, we are going to just be completely insecure and return the same username as the token. Tip In the next chapter, you will see a real secure implementation, with password hashing and JWT tokens. But for now, let's focus on the specific details we need.

It's almost the only thing that you have to remember to do correctly yourself, to be compliant with the specifications. For the rest, FastAPI handles it for you. Update the dependencies \u00b6 Now we are going to update our dependencies. We want to get the current_user only if this user is active. So, we create an additional dependency get_current_active_user that in turn uses get_current_user as a dependency. Both of these dependencies will just return an HTTP error if the user doesn't exist, or if is inactive.

Also, there might be tools that expect and use it (now or in the future) and that might be useful for you or your users, now or in the future. That's the benefit of standards... See it in action \u00b6 Open the interactive docs: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs . Authenticate \u00b6 Click the \"Authorize\" button. Use the credentials: User: johndoe Password: secret After authenticating in the system, you will see it like: Get your own user data \u00b6 Now use the operation GET with the path /users/me . You will get your user's data, like: { \"username\" : \"johndoe\" , \"email\" : \"johndoe@example.com\" , \"full_name\" : \"John Doe\" , \"disabled\" : false , \"hashed_password\" : \"fakehashedsecret\" } If you click the lock icon and logout, and then try the same operation again, you will get an HTTP 401 error of: { \"detail\" : \"Not authenticated\" } Inactive user \u00b6 Now try with an inactive user, authenticate with: User: alice Password: secret2 And try to use the operation GET with the path /users/me . You will get an \"inactive user\" error, like: { \"detail\" : \"Inactive user\" } Recap \u00b6 You now have the tools to implement a complete security system based on username and password for your API. Using these tools, you can make the security system compatible with any database and with any user or data model. The only detail missing is that it is not actually \"secure\" yet. In the next chapter you'll see how to use a secure password hashing library and JWT tokens.","title":"Simple OAuth2 with Password and Bearer"},{"location":"tutorial/security/simple-oauth2/#simple-oauth2-with-password-and-bearer","text":"Warning The current page still doesn't have a translation for this language.

Any HTTP (error) status code 401 \"UNAUTHORIZED\" is supposed to also return a WWW-Authenticate header. In the case of bearer tokens (our case), the value of that header should be Bearer . You can actually skip that extra header and it would still work. But it's provided here to be compliant with the specifications. Also, there might be tools that expect and use it (now or in the future) and that might be useful for you or your users, now or in the future.
